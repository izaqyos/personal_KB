1. 
P. sfe with ddd won't lauch. can't find nylicense.so.
S.put traffic_limit.so_name as full path to bin dir of INFRA.

2. 
P. strange compilation errors. missing needed environment variables.
for example NY_MAKE_INC.
S. exit view; enter view; compile

3. 
P. installing base package on machine but user smsc prompt and shell is screwd.
S. check .cshrc. try removing $OMNI and/or ORACLE conds. if it's the ORACLE then you probably should install the oracle client first.

4. in view or on installed machine rm_get won't work ("not found").
Either starter link at is no correct - smsc should be linked to the correct starter.[infra ver].
Or at .nyappl the file smsc.sfe.[sfe ver] contains the wrong infra.[inf ver] infra version.

4. 
P. make fails.
S. 1. maybe some of the env vars are missing. 4 example NY_ARCH_EXT. try entering the view again.


5.
S. Mirror standby in a loop of rcp failed.
P. Try the following:
	1. open mirroring in sfe.debug_names/instructions.
	2. try and activate the rcp command in the shell
	3. check why it failed. fix it.
