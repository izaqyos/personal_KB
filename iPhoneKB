		1.1.1 Tip: Quickly set your iPhone auto-correct with multiple languages

iPhone auto-correct feature is far from perfect. As you can read in the site Damn You Auto Correct, your iPhone can embarrass you quite easily. But it is even worse if you need to text in different languages, because the iPhone uses the default language to auto correct. So, how do you change the language of your auto-correct without changing the iPhone’s language?

Here you have the steps:

    Go to your iPhone main screen and tap on “Settings”
    Then tap on “General”
    Now tap on “Keyboard”
    Now you can disable “Auto-Correction” altogether, if you want, just turning off the “Auto-Correction” switch. But let’s leave it on for a now
    Now tap on “International Keyboards”
    In this list tap on the option “Add New Keyboard” which is at the bottom.
    Now select the languages you use for texting.
    If you add a language incorrectly, tap on “Edit” at the top right and then delete.

Now you can go and write a new text message, email or any text in any iPhone app. When you do it, you will see a small key with a “globe” on it, right on the left of the space bar. When you tap on this key, the language of your keyboard changes and also the language for the autocorrect.

Easy right? Try it and let me know how it went!

		2.3.1 iTunes: How to re-create your iTunes library and playlists

Summary
The iTunes Library files store information about your iTunes library, such as what songs are available for iTunes to use, but they do not store your actual song files. The two iTunes Library files are:

iTunes Library ("iTunes Library.itl" in Windows) is a database of the songs in your library and the playlists you've created. Some song-specific data is saved in this file. If you delete the file, iTunes creates a new, empty copy when you open the application, but any playlists, song ratings, comments, or other information you created will be lost. The iTunes Library file is only used by iTunes.
iTunes Library.xml contains some (but not all) of the same information stored in the iTunes Library file. The purpose of the iTunes Library.xml file is to make your music and playlists available to other applications on your computer. If you delete the file, iTunes creates a new copy from the iTunes Library file.
Your iTunes Library file may become damaged and cause iTunes to become unresponsive. The "iTunes Library.xml" file may be used to re-create a new iTunes Library file.

Re-creating the iTunes Library file is a very specific troubleshooting step which you should only perform if you have been directed to do so by a specific troubleshooting article.

See the list below to first find more specific troubleshooting articles for the issue you are experiencing (if you have not done so already).

Re-creating the iTunes Library file

Note: After re-creating your library, any devices that you sync with iTunes (Apple TV, iPod, iPhone, iPad) will see your iTunes library as a new library and will completely resync. The next sync with such a device will take longer and may reset some options since your rebuilt library isn't familiar to the device.

|1. Quit iTunes.

|2. Locate your iTunes folder (this is the folder that contains the iTunes Library and iTunes Library.xml files).

Operating System	Default location of iTunes Folder
Mac OS X	/Users/[your username]/Music
Microsoft Windows XP	\Documents and Settings\[your username]\My Documents\My Music\
Microsoft Windows Vista	\Users\[your username]\Music\
Microsoft Windows 7	\Users\[your username]\My Music\
 

|3. Open your iTunes folder.

|4. Drag the "iTunes Library.xml" file to the Desktop. If the "iTunes Library.xml" file is not available, learn how to add files back to the Library (because the "iTunes Library.xml" file is not available, playlists and other information will not be available).

|5. Drag the following file from your iTunes folder to the Trash:

Mac OS X	"iTunes Library"
Microsoft Windows	"iTunes Library.itl"
 

|6. Open iTunes.

Important: Do not add any content into iTunes at this point (such as by purchasing something from the iTunes Store).

|7. Choose File > Library > Import Playlist.

|8. Navigate to the "iTunes Library.xml" file on the Desktop.

Mac users: Click Choose.
Windows users: Click Open.
If your Podcasts list in iTunes is empty after following these steps, learn how to add them back into iTunes.

Additional Information
You can move your iTunes library to a new computer if you are trying to re-create the same library on the new computer.
