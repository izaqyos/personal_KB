1. Keyboard Shortcuts

To help you boost your productivity when using your Mac, we’re providing you with a cheat sheet featuring all of the top and most important keyboard shortcuts for Mac OS:
Modifier Key Symbols
Many keyboard shortcuts include at least one modifier key. It's important to know what these symbols are because on application menus, which are great for finding out keyboard shortcuts on the fly, you'll only see symbols and letters listed next to the menu options.
⌘	Command - Located on both sides of the spacebar.
^	Control - Located between the fn and option keys.
⌥	Option/Alt - Located next to the command keys (on both sides).
⇧	Shift - The first and last keys on the second row of keys from the bottom (above the row with spacebar, command, option, control, fn).
⇪	Cap Locks - Located above the shift key on the left side of the keyboard.
⌫	Delete - Located at the right end of the number keys row (last button).
fn	Function - The first key on the bottom row, next to the control/alt key.
⏏	Media Eject - Located at the top right corner of the keyboard.
Startup
Press and hold the key or key combination during the startup process, until the expected function occurs.
Option	Display all bootable volumes; if you're a Boot Camp user, you can also choose to boot in Windows from here (Startup Manager)
Shift	Perform a Safe Boot (start up in Safe Mode)
Left Shift	Prevent automatic login; if you have your Mac set to automatically login without prompting for a password, this will temporarily disable it.
C	Start from bootable media (DVD, CD, USB thumb drive, etc)
T	Start in FireWire target disk mode, which allows a Mac with a FireWire port to be used as an external hard disk connected to another computer.
N	Start from NetBoot server; if your Mac is capable, you can boot from a network rather than a hard disk.
X	Force Mac OS X startup (if non-Mac OS X startup volumes are present)
D	Use Apple Hardware Test, a suite of diagnostics that will test your hardware for issues.
Command-R	Use Recovery (OS X Lion or later) to repair your hard disk or reinstall OS X if needed, without the need for discs.
Command-V	Start in Verbose Mode to see what is happening during system startup (command line will be displayed), which is great for troubleshooting.
Command-S	Start in Single User Mode, which is much like Verbose Mode, but keeps the command line showing instead of moving into the graphical interface.
Command-Option-P-R	Reset NVRAM / parameter RAM, which can help if you're having issues with your volume, screen resolution, statup disk selection or kernel panic.
Hold down the Media Eject key or F12 key	Eject removable discs from your DVD/CD ROM drive.
Sleep and Shut Down
Use these shortcuts to quickly shut down or put your Mac to sleep.
Power button	Turn off your Mac or put it to sleep
Hold down the power button	Force your Mac to shut down
Command-Control-power button	Force your Mac to restart
Control-Media Eject	Show the restart/sleep/shutdown dialog and you can choose the option that you'd like.

		2.3.2 Cannot enable Phone Services	
Refreshed to a Mac for the first time, following the instructions for setting up Jabber. I already went through eStore to request phone and video services, and received a confirmation email that the request is complete. Under Jabber-->Preferences-->Accounts Voicemail has the nice green checkmark, but Phone Services continues to have the dreaded red X, and it keeps telling me "invalid credentials". I assume under "User Settings" I'm supposed to put my CEC username and password, right? So what could be wrong?
 
Thanks,

Hi Jamal,

Some questions:

What version of Jabber Mac did you download?

Have you used the calling/phone feature on your Mac before?

Could you try syncing your CEC username and password in phone.cisco.com?

 

Also, could you send me a screenshot of your phone account options with server info/error message?

Thanks,

David

Mac OS X Maverick: Re-enable Tap and Drag on a Trackpad or Touchpad
     Posted by Jimmy Selix in Apple Mac
Logo
Apple laptops have one of the best trackpads in the industry.  However, after OS X Lion, Apple decided to hide tap and drag options deep within the Preferences. This technique is an alternative method for moving icons, windows, and other items by just tapping on an item and then moving your finger on the trackpad.  This is very useful if you do not have a clickable trackpad or if you just miss this feature.


Prior to OS X Lion, you could tap and drag to select text, move icons and windows in any app where you had to select items.  For power users, this is a very handy feature and is useful for those users with Macs that do not have a multi-gesture capable touchpad or trackpad.

| 1. Go into Preferences.
| 
| 2. Go to Accessibility.

IPHOTO WON’T IMPORT IPHONE 4 MEDIA: A FIX
JUNE 23, 2010 CALPERNIA ADDAMS 11 COMMENTS

iPhoto blank when you plug in your iPhone 4 ?
Has this happened to anyone else? My old iPhone 3G and 3GS always connected fine with iPhoto 9 (v 8.1.2 424). You plug in the phone, it shows as a device in the left side of iPhoto and the images/video are there to be imported. With my new iPhone 4, i plug it in, open iPhoto, it shows as a device BUT there is no media to be imported, even though the camera roll has items in it.

By following the steps below, I am able to get iPhoto to see my iPhone 4 and its contents for ONE TIME ONLY. Then the process below must be repeated and the computer restarted before iPhone 4 media can be accessed in iPhoto again. It appears that you do not always need to restart the computer.

Quit iPhoto
Open Activity Monitor (Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor.app)
In the search window at the top right, search for PTPCamera
Click on PTPCamera in the list of results to highlight it
Click on Quit Process (the red stopsign icon in the upper left of Activity Monitor)
Choose “Quit”
If you don’t already see “Image Capture Extension” in the list, search for it in the search box. Click on “Image Capture Extension” in the list of results to highlight it
Click on Quit Process (the red stopsign icon in the upper left of Activity Monitor)
Choose “Quit”
Go to Macintosh HD > System > Library > Image Capture > Devices and double click PTPCamera.app to open it back up.
Unplug and re-plug the iPhone 4. iPhoto should open, if you’ve set it to do so when a camera is plugged in. Otherwise, open it. You should see your media available for import from the iPhone 4 when you click on the iPhone 4 in the devices list.

	8.1 pbpaste pbcopy 

		8.1.1 Accessing the OS X Clipboard from the Command Line
   
terminal-icon-512x5122 With the pbcopy and pbpaste commands, you can use the command line to manipulate clipboard contents but also access your Mac OS X clipboard directly through the Terminal. Yes, that means you can access what you copied in a GUI app and use it in the command line seamlessly, and vice versa. We’ve shown a brief introduction on how to use both pbcopy and pbpaste from the command line before, but we wanted to demonstrate a few additional methods to use these incredibly useful tools on the Mac, like how to directly access whatever is currently stored in the Macs clipboard from the terminal prompt.



 
Accessing the OS X Clipboard Contents with pbpaste
pbpaste – pbpaste is how you dump the currently active contents of the clipboard. If you just want to see what’s in the clipboard, simply type this:

pbpaste

You’ll see whatever is stored in the clipboard right now, as if you hit Command+V in OS X.

You can also easily store the contents of the clipboard into a file by using pbpaste, as follows:

pbpaste > clipboard.txt

Now you’ll have the document clipboard.txt with the contents of your clipboard. You can double-check this by opening it in any text editor, or by typing
cat clipboard.txt
to see the contents.

Adding Contents to the Clipboard with pbcopy
pbcopy – as you might imagine, pbcopy is how you can copy things from the command line. This is basically like using Comamnd+C in the Finder or GUI of OS X. The best way to use it is by piping something into pbcopy, for example:

ls -lha |pbcopy

This will pipe the results of ls -lha into your clipboard, which you can now access using the pbpaste command.

Now that you’ve copied something to the clipboard of OS X with pbcopy you can dump the output back into the Terminal by using pbpaste, if you had just run the ls -lha|pbcopy command, the output will be that.

You can learn more about modifying the clipboard from the terminal by redirecting command output here with pipes and redirects to the pbcopy command.

pbcopy and pbpaste can even work across networks by using ssh or other protocols, check this out:

Pasting Clipboard Contents Across Networks with SSH & pbpaste
pbcopy and pbpaste are a lot more powerful than the above examples though. Here’s how to use pbpaste to send the contents of your clipboard to another machine, by piping the output through an ssh connection into a file named myclipboard.txt on the remote machine:

pbpaste | ssh username@host 'cat > ~/myclipboard.txt'

Nice huh?

13. Arm based macs 

    13.1  Run intel based binaries

        13.1.1  https://indiespark.top/software/run-command-line-apple-silicon/, tags: rosetta 2
a. Open the Terminal app.
b. Open the Terminal app’s Preferences.
c. Click on the Profiles tab.
d. Select a profile, click on the ellipsis at the bottom of the profile list and then select Duplicate Profile.
e. Click on the new profile and give it a good name. I named mine as “Rosetta Shell”.
Also in the new profile, click on the Window tab. In the Title, put a name to indicate that this is for running Intel-based apps. I put “Terminal - Intel” on mine.
f. Click on the Shell tab and use the following as its Run Command to force the shell run under Rosetta:
    f1 for zsh
env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh --login
    f2 for bash
env /usr/bin/arch -x86_64 /bin/bash --login
Untick the Run inside shell checkbox. Clearing the checkbox would prevent running the shell twice, which could bloat your environment variables since ~/.bas/zshrc gets run twice.
Optionally set this profile as the Default.

Then install Homebrew in a separate location 
cd /usr/local
sudo mkdir homebrew
sudo chgrp admin homebrew
sudo chmod g+rwx homebrew
curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew

oneliner:
cd /usr/local && sudo mkdir homebrew && sudo chgrp admin homebrew && sudo chmod g+rwx homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C homebrew

Add the following snippet to your ~/.zshrc to automatically choose which Homebrew installation to use depending whether it is running on Rosetta:
if [ "$(sysctl -n sysctl.proc_translated)" = "1" ]; then
    local brew_path="/usr/local/homebrew/bin"
else
    local brew_path="/opt/homebrew/bin"
fi
export PATH="${brew_path}:${PATH}"

note, sysctl didn't work for me. I ended up adding this to .bashrc
#compatible to either intel or arm homebrew PATH
set_brew_path_intel(){
#if [ "$(sysctl -n sysctl.proc_translated)" = "1" ]; then
#    local brew_path="/opt/homebrew/bin"
#else
#    local brew_path="/usr/local/homebrew/bin"
#fi
local brew_path="/usr/local/homebrew/bin"
export PATH="${brew_path}:${PATH}"
}
set_brew_path_intel

last use intel brew on rosetta terminal to install and then run cf cli
$ brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli
