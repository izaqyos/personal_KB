etags
My usual tool is etags, but that doesn't really help show call graphs etags will follow the control flow downwards with the find-tag command (M-. in Emacs). It's useful at times, but a little pedestrian for what I want to do.
cscope
cscope will show me all callers for a function. This is closer, but it's still not overly easy to read.

There's also the XEmacs interface to cscope, at sourceforge. I'm not sure how useful it is for you, but it's what I use for browsing (disclaimer: then again, I wrote that interface).
Source navigator
Jeffrey Hsu introduced me to Source Navigator in August 2004. It gives a graphical representation of the downwards control tree for a function. It doesn't seem to be able to go in the other direction, i.e show what functions call a specific function. The FreeBSD port also currently installs in a place you wouldn't expect, and the documentation doesn't match: you need to run the program /usr/local/sourcenav/bin/snavigator I have a bug report against this problem.
doxygen
doxygen documentation as well. That does fine in a downward direction, but in my case I'm trying to fit an API under the package, so I really need to see what is calling me, and doxygen doesn't do that. Arguably the graphic representation is nicer.

As I understand it, doxygen can be configured to produce both call graphs and called-by graphs.
kscope
kscope is a KDE wrapper for cscope. KDE programs scare me, with reason: just installing it pulled in 86 (really!) other packages, including Samba and OpenLDAP.

Once I started it, it produced no useful output, and though I haven't given up, the interface turns me off: popups with windows too small to enter text in. It's reminiscent of k3b, with which I had so many problems in June 2005. After installing it, I couldn't get it to do anything useful, but the following day I managed to import some files (you have to specify the names as a subset wild card: * doesn't do anything). It can indeed display an upside-down calling function tree:

call tree

Once again I have this terrible layout; the window is far too small, the text too big, the fields are truncated, I can't find a way to change the default size of the window, and there are not even normal resizing buttons. I've already told it to use smaller fonts, which it does in some places, but not here.

This is the window thrown up after you manually enter the name of the function (bp_wrap_file_write) and click on all the + boxes up to the top level call (in this case, process_connection). But I'm left wondering if it's worth the trouble:

    * Having to type in the name of the function is a real pain.
    *     * Once you do, it gives you a too-small window in an over-large font with only part of the information.
    *         * To actually see the call tree, you need multiple mouse clicks per branch.
    *             * When you see the tree, it doesn't help you much. You can't get to the function.
    *
    *             In fact, the window contains (rather than displays) more information: it's hidden behind the scroll bars:
    *
    *             call tree
    *
    *             You still can't do anything with it; the corresponding cscope output is more useful, since despite its unfriendly interface, it at least allows you at the sources.
    *
    *             I've never liked eye candy and GUIs for the sake of it, but in this case a GUI would be a good idea. It's sad that it has failed so badly.
    *             Other suggestions
    *             The following are suggestions that I have received and on which I need to follow up. When I do, I'll move them to their own section above. I'm quoting mail messages here.
    *             global

    *             A program suite called `global' was once part of freebsd which I liked quite a bit. It even created web pages where you can click on function calls to take you to their defn and so on. I believe there was a cross-ref as well (callers of a function). But it has been a while....
