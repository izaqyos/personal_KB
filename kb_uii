1. Consistency between form, action and class names:
 
check whether you have given the correct name for the property repositoryName in get set method in your form bean class like this:

public XXX getRepositoryName(){
} 
 
Please note that repositoryName should start with capital 'R' as mentioned above.

public void setRepositoryName(XXX){
}

Also, please check if your struts-config.xml entry is pointing to the correct formbean class.This class should have the above getter/setter methods. As an example, following is your entry in the struts-config,
    <action path="/s140" 
            name="dataTypeCompForm" 
            validate="false"
            type="com.cisco.nm.uii.example.action.DataTypeComponentsAction"/>
 
Here "dataTypeCompForm" is the name of your form bean with the following entry in struts-config.xml
<form-bean name="dataTypeCompForm"
      type="com.cisco.nm.uii.example.actionform.DataTypeComponentsActionForm" />

In the RepositorySelection.jsp, following is the entry:
 
<uii:form action="rulesel.do"> 
 
The corresponding entry in struts-config.xml is follows:
 
   <action path="/rulesel" name="RS-FB" 
       type="com.cisco.nm.uii.example.action.RuleSelectionAction"/>
 
As seen above the screenid, rulesel is mapped to the formbean RS-FB which is of type RuleSelectionFormBean.
 
 <form-bean name="RS-FB" type="com.cisco.nm.uii.example.actionForm.RuleSelectionFormBean" />
 
Here, as the RuleSelectionFormBean does not have the getter/setter methods for the property repositoryName, hence this error. If we give <uii:form action="RepositorySelection.do"> , it works fine. Probably , you may think of having the same form bean for both the screen ids to avoid this issue.


2. Error No input attribute for mapping path /XXX
Form validation fails.

3. Error Problem with File /WEB-INF/screens/uii/RuleEdit.jsp!!!No getter method for property ruleName of bean org.apache.struts.taglib.html.BEAN 
Make sure attribute and setters/getters are consistent.
