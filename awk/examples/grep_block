#Basically, we have several files which have the format:
#item	info line 1
#info line 2
#.
#.
#.
#info line n
#Where each info line refers to the item and is indented by either
#spaces or tabs.  Each item "block" is separated by a blank line.
#What I need to do, is to be able to type:
#info glitch filename
#Where info is the name of the perl script, glitch is what I want to
#find out about, and filename is the name of the file with the
#information in it.  The catch is that I need it to print the entire
#"block" if it finds glitch anywhere in the file, i.e.:
#machine		Sun 3/75
#8 meg memory
#Prone to memory glitches
#more info
#more info
#would get printed if you looked for "glitch" along with any other
#"blocks" which contained the word glitch.

!#/bin/sh

awk 'BEGIN { FS = "\n"; RS = "" }
$0 ~ search { print $0 }' search=$1 $2
