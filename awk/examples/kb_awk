1. pretty print results of awk
	1.1 example:
		$ grep  ismg change_set_12_06  | awk -F"@" '{print $1}' | awk -F"\\" '{print "Lib: " $4 ", File " $5}' |sort | uniq
		ignore the grep and sort and the first awk, note the print command.

2. Count number of lines on multiple files
	example:
	find . -name "*.csv" -exec wc -l '{}' \; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}

3. Calculate average for a column of numbers
	example, calulate MSC average:
	cat Yosi_Izaq_MSc_Grades.strip  | awk '{sum += $5; courses+=1} END {print sum " " courses-1 " " sum/(courses-1)}'

4. Add line after line specific line number
	4.1 example add after first line the line "bbb"
	awk ' {print} NR==1 {print "bbb"} ' stam 

	4.2 Using sed for similar tast, add comment in line 137-139.
	sed -i~ -e '137/*' -e '139i*/' test.cpp

	5.1 Using AWK

		5.1.1 invoking awk
		    awk 'instructions' files
		    awk -f script files

		5.1.2 how does it work?
		Awk, in the usual case, interprets each input line as a record and each word on that line, delimited by spaces or tabs, as a field. (These defaults can be changed.) One or more consecutive spaces or tabs count as a single delimiter. Awk allows you to reference these fields, in either patterns or procedures. $0 represents the entire input line. $1, $2, ... refer to the individual fields on the input line. Awk splits the input record before the script is applied.
		5.1.3 Basic examples

		a single instruction that prints the first field of each line in the input file.
		awk '{ print $1 }' list

		a pattern "/MA/" is specified but there is no procedure. The default action is to print each line that matches the pattern.
		awk '/MA/' list

		print first field of only lines that match "MA".
		awk '/MA/ { print $1 }' list

		Default awk will seperate words (delimiter is white spaces), this example changes delimiter to ,
		awk -F, '/MA/ { print $1 }' list

		 print each field on its own line. Multiple commands are separated by semicolons.
		$ awk -F, '{ print $1; print $2; print $3 }' list

	5.2 Pattern Matching
		
	When awk reads an input line, it attempts to match each pattern-matching rule in a script. Only the lines matching the particular pattern are the object of an action. If no action is specified, the line that matches the pattern is printed (executing the print statement is the default action). 

		5.2.1 print all empty lines:
		/^$/ { print "This is a blank line." }
