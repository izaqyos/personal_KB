1. list processes and their stats.
	$ procps -AF

2. process tree
	$ pstree 

3. Install freescope.
	version 3.0.1 doesn't build well on cygwin. a solution is to copy to windows exe to /usr/sbin.
	The exe is located at "d:\backup\apps\source browesers"  and can be d/ld from the web.

4. X user's guide

	4.1 Display

		4.1.1 Opening remote clients
Displaying Remote Clients

Displaying remote X clients with Cygwin/X is nearly identical to displaying remote X clients with any other X Server. You may use the secure ssh method, or the unsecure telnet method (not recommended).
Secure ssh

On your Windows machine:

|   1.  Make sure you have the openssh package installed.
|   2.  Launch Cygwin/X, if not installed use the setup program to select xinit package under x11 category . Also install twm and fvwm
either launch xwin (windows key + xwin), then right click to open xterm. or use $ startx /usr/bin/fvwm2
|   3.  Run the following in an X terminal:
|Username@CygwinHost ~ $ ssh -Y -l username remote_hostname_or_ip_address
|
|   4.  Enter your password when prompted by ssh.
|   5.  Your ssh session should now show you a shell prompt for your remote machine.
|   6.  You can now launch remote X clients in your ssh session, for example, xterm& will launch an xterm running on your remote host that will display on your Cygwin/X screen.
|   7.  Launch other remote clients in the same manner. I recommend starting the remote clients in the background, by appending & to the command name, so that you don't have to open several ssh sessions.

Unsecure Telnet

On your Windows machine:

|   1.  Make sure you have the inetutils package installed.
|   2.  Launch Cygwin/X
|   3.  In an X terminal type /usr/X11R6/bin/xhost remote_hostname_or_ip_address
|   4.  In an X terminal type /usr/bin/telnet remote_hostname_or_ip_address. Use the explicit path to ensure that Cygwin's telnet is run instead of Microsoft's telnet; Microsoft's telnet will crash on startup when run from Cygwin/X.
|   5.  Login to your remote machine via your telnet session
|   6.  In your telnet session type, DISPLAY=windows_hostname_or_ip_address:0.0
|   7.  In your telnet session type, export DISPLAY
|   8.  You can now launch remote X clients in your telnet session, for example, xterm& will launch an xterm running on your remote host that will display on your Cygwin/X screen.
|   9.  Launch other remote clients in the same manner; I recommend starting the remote clients in the background, by appending & to the command name, so that you don't have to open several telnet sessions.

		4.1.2

	4.2 X windows system


		4.2.1 How to start
$ startx 
Use a script for starting the X system. Very useful

In case it doesn't work use:
$ X -multiwindow -clipboard
And then right click the X server icon and choose Applications->xterm
From this xterm run the personal startup script:
$. ~/.bashrc
$. ~/.aliases
$start 
or 
$ mini_start

5. Make windows start applications (not Cygwin)

	5.1 cygstart
man cygstart
for more details

example:
$cygstart gvim




6.  Troubleshoot

	6.1  Cygwin+Windows 7+gvim woes
Yosi Izaq to vim_use
Hi,

I've upgrade from XP to windows 7 and now gvim launched from Cygwin
spews errors on startup.
Sometime gvim would load but at other times it would fail that.
An example of the errors:

0 [main] gvim 7404 exception::handle: Exception:
STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
  4374 [main] gvim 7404 open_stackdumpfile: Dumping stack trace to
gvim.exe.stackdump
ShowFunc exting.  (Cleaning up functions)
Error detected while processing /home/yizaq/.vim/plugin/ShowFunc.vim:
line  450:

exception::handle: Exception: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION

     0 [main] gvim 7096 C:\cygwin\bin\gvim.exe: *** fatal error -

End of stack trace
     0 [main] gvim 4532 fork: child 7096 - died waiting for dll
loading, errno 11

In addition even when gvim does load the '!' doesn't work and gives a
"fail to fork" error.
I did some searching on the web and it looks likes many suspect a bug
in the Mcafee antivirus. I even tried some suggestions like excluding /
cygwin/bin from access scanning but it didn't really help.

Has anyone faced a similar issue?- I'd appreciate any information on
the matter.

TIA,
Yosi

Bryan Hunt to me, vim_use

I hate this error, I used to get it before I did the smart thing and
dumped cygwin.

Cygwin does some wierd stuff with Dll's, I don't know exactly what and
I'm not entirely interested either.

The cure for your problem is to run ash ( a minimal shell that ships with
cygwin ) from the windows command prompt ( not from within Cygwin or an
xterm ).

Enter the following command.

/bin/rebaseall

You might need to reboot, it's windows after all.

I found that I was repeating this process once twice or thrice a month.

Here's more on the subject:

- Show quoted text -


i have found this problem with almost every project i build from source in win7 under cygwin.  the fix is rather straightforward, and is a cygwin issue, not a vim issue:  it is necessary to "rebase" all applications, libraries, and dll's in cygwin.

the simple cookbook is:

| 1.  do a shutdown of all cygwin services and apps.
| (http://www.heikkitoivonen.net/blog/2008/11/26/cygwin-upgrades-and-rebaseall/)
| for example:
| 
|        cygrunsrv --stop cron
|        cygrunsrv --stop exim
|        cygrunsrv --stop mountd
|        cygrunsrv --stop nfsd
|        cygrunsrv --stop portmap
|        cygrunsrv --stop sshd
|        cygrunsrv --stop cygserver
| 
| 2.  initiate a cmd session
| 3.  cd \cygwin\bin
| 4.  .\ash.exe
| 5.  PATH=/bin
| 6.  find /usr/local -name '*.dll' -o -name '*.so' > /tmp/lst
| 7.  rebaseall -v -T /tmp/lst

Thank you and Bryan as well. Your suggestions solved the issue and I also read the related Cygwin article to better understand what the fuss is all about. The cookbook solution is especially effective. 

I have 2 follow-up questions if you may:
| 1. Should I repeat the rebase each time I upgrade a give cygwin lib or util?
| 2. Do you happen to know when will Cygwin include the rebase so that it's no longer required to perform this manually?

Thanks!

	6.2 C++ dev

	    6.2.1 Getting cout not found and loads of link errors on ostream
reason gcc doesn't link w/ standard lib. use g++ instead

see:
Compile the program with:

g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -c main.cpp -o main.o
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ <- For listing all warnings when your code is compiled.
as cout is present in the C++ standard library, which would need explicit linking with -lstdc++ when using gcc; g++ links the standard library by default.

With gcc, (g++ should be preferred over gcc)

gcc main.cpp -lstdc++ -o main.o

7. VIM

    7.1 setup
Basically copy from windows vim $VIMRUNTIME to cygwin

 86  ls /usr/share/vim/vim80/
   87  cd /usr/share/vim/vim80/
   90  cp -r  ~/.vim/* .

copy pathogen
   93  find /cygdrive/c/vim -iname pathogen
   94  find /cygdrive/c/vim -iname '*path*'
   95  cd autoload/
   96  cp /cygdrive/c/vim/vim80/autoload/pathogen.vim .
   97  vim
   98  vim pathogen.vim 
   set ff=unix

   99  vim
   
   copy colors
  100  cd ../colors/
  101  cp /cygdrive/c/vim/vim80/colors/
  102  ls /cygdrive/c/vim/vim80/colors/
  103  cp  /cygdrive/c/vim/vim80/colors/* .

8. Install packages

    8.1 wget 


wget is its own package -> http://cygwin.com/packages/wget/
$ cygcheck -f $( which wget )
wget-1.13.4-1
