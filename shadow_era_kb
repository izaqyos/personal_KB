 ZTC 3.0 - The Feedbomb Dynamo

    I wasn't going to post this deck till after WC, but meh, it's already been sort of posted via the A1 Epic Matches between Caitlyn0 and me, so why not share and stop the speculation.

    This version has been HEAVILY played / tweaked / tested / revamped / redone / reworked / broken / rebuilt. I'm not saying it can't be improved upon, but you'll be hard pressed to try many new things I haven't already tinkered with extensively. If any of the cards listed below seem unnecessary, or like they shouldn't be there (not to sound too elitist), you're probably mistaken.

    I won't, however, share the tech to making it work right now, although anyone else is welcome to add their own commentary to it. That said, you're in for one hell of a ride.


    I give you, Zaladar Total Control 3.0, The Feedbomb Dynamo!


    Zaladar

    3x Infernal Gargoyle
    3x Brutalis
    3x Fire Snake
    3x Death Mage Thaddeus

    2x Conversion
    2x Soul Reaper
    4x Mind Control
    3x Feedback
    2x Eternal Renewal
    4x Shadow Font
    2x Ley Line Nexus
    4x Bazaar
    4x Bad Santa

    2x Sliver of Shadow


I have updated the second post of this thread that explains, in detail, why each card was chosen, and what its best role(s) are for the deck. Also, I included an example of a medium-sized Feedbomb chain, but it made the post too long to add, so I have included it below here. I hope the edited post #2, and this example Feedbomb chain help anyone who is having any trouble grasping the winning strategy of this deck.



The Art of Feedbombing - Feedbombing looks very straightforward on the surface, but you may find it will take you some practice to get used to, and more importantly, do to maximum effectiveness. Essentially, a Feedbomb is using Feedback alongside your draw engines, Bazaar and Bad Santa, to play far more cards in a given turn than your resources would otherwise permit you to do. After turn 8, Feedbombing can become absolutely devastating for your opponent. It at all possible, you always want to start a Feedbomb sequence with 5 cards in hand, and by beginning with Bad Santa. A Feedbomb sequence started after a Soul Reaper/Eternal Renweal combo is absolutely devastating. Another aspect of performing effective Feedbomb chains is knowing what you have already played/sacrificed, and what remains in your deck. For instance, if you have 20 cards left in your deck, and have only see one Bad Santa, and no Feedbacks, the odds that the next Feedbomb sequence you will start will end up as a large chain are very good. Conversely, if you've already played 3 Bad Santas and 2 Feedbacks, those last 20 cards are not likely to hold much promise of a good Feedbomb chain for you. Always keep a mental note of the power cards you've sacrificed and what is in your graveyard. Always.


Here is an example of a Feedbomb Chain:

You have, at the start of turn 8, after sacrificing to 8 resources:

4 Shadow Energy

Feedback
Bad Santa
Sliver of Shadow
Mind Control
Soul Reaper

Your opponent has Aldon the Brave and Raven on the board.


Play: Bad Santa, draw 3 cards, up to 7 in hand. This yields you: Brutalis, Fire Snake, Bad Santa.
You have 6 resources left, and in hand you have:
Feedback
Bad Santa
Sliver of Shadow
Mind Control
Soul Reaper
Brutalis
Fire Snake

You play Brutalis and Fire Snake, bringing you to 3 resources available. You then play Feedback. Now you're @ 8 resources, and in hand you have:
Bad Santa
Sliver of Shadow
Mind Control
Soul Reaper

Play Bad Santa again, yielding you: Death Mage Thadeus, Shadow Font, and Feedback. You now have 6 resources and in hand you have:
Sliver of Shadow
Mind Control
Soul Reaper
Death Mage Thadeus
Shadow Font
Feedback

Use your ZalBlast on your opponent's hero, and on Aldon, putting him at 1 health, dropping you to no Shadow Energy; play Sliver of Shadow, taking you to 3 resources; play Feedback. Now you are up to 8 resources and have in hand:
Mind Control
Soul Reaper
Death Mage Thadeus
Shadow Font

Play Mind Control on Raven, killing her, and dealing 3 damage to your opponent's hero; play Death Mage, using his ping damage to kill Aldon, attack your opponent's hero for 2 damage with the Sliver of Shadow.


You have now, in a single turn, put three allies on the board, removed two of your enemy's allies, and dealt 8 damage to your opponent. Also, you have a Sliver of Shadow on the board with durability left on it, and still a Shadow Font and Soul Reaper in hand. So, if next turn, you were to draw (with Bazaar in play, of course) an Eternal Renewal and another Feedback, you could play Shadow Font, Feedback, Soul Reaper, finished up with Eternal Renewal, setting up your next turn to start the chain all over again.

This may all sound extreme, but this is a fairly average Feedbomb Chain. Some are shorter, draw-depending, and some are much longer, again, draw-depending. 

Zaladar
Clearly the more powerful of the two Elemental heroes. His Energy Blast is an invaluable tool at both keeping the board clear of allies, as well as being a constant source of damage for your opponent's hero. 




Ally selection - I wanted to include only very utilitarian allies in this deck; things that were quick to get out, tough to kill for their cost, and that made controlling the board easier.

Infernal Gargoyle
Tougher to kill than any (3) ally in the game; attracts attention from the enemy, and usually results in at least 2 sources of damage being directed its way. It's attack plus ZalBlast kills everything in the game but Infernal Gargoyle, Armored Sandworm, Brutal Minotaur, Aeon, Raven, and Ogloth. 

Brutalis
Has the most staying power of any (2) ally, and can live through going second; adds the 1 point of damage that allows ZalBlast to kill every (3) ally (or less) in the game except Infernal Gargoyle; often gets ignored by your opponent because it its (seemingly) weak attack power. 

Fire Snake
Toughest (1) ally in the game, and can trade blows with/kill all others, and Blake; a turn 1 Fire Snake sets up a turn 2 Santa Bomb, which is SUPER useful if you didn't draw a Bazaar on turn 1; Fire Snake helps to mitigate the lack of a turn 2 Brutalis. 

Death Mage Thaddeus
Ping ability helps to set up ZalBlast to kill all (3) allies, except Infernal Gargoyle; direct damage ability bypasses armor that your enemy's hero may have; ability sets up ZalBlast to kill all allies in the game except those noted above under the Infernal Gargoyle entry; Death Mage is resistant to control methods that simply prevent an ally from attacking. 




Life Gain - The original versions of this deck did not have any life gaining cards, and a major weakness I found was their ability to go swing-for-swing against faster-paced, heavy damage decks, especially Mages. I tried a number of alternatives, including Armor of Ages, and even some extensive tinkering with Dome of Energy. None of these did the trick, and life gain seemed to be the only solution. Originally 1x Soul Reaper and 2x Conversion, I found that drawing a Soul Reaper in my opening hand was tantamount to not having one in the deck to begin with. ZTC requires such important decision making sacrifice choices early on, that holding a Soul Reaper for 6-7 turns on the chance that it would be vital to the endgame was not a viable option. So, it went to 2. Now you can safely sacrifice one drawn early, knowing there's another in the deck to fall back on. 

Conversion
Early in the game this is easy sac fodder (when very little of that exists in this deck); later in the game it can be the difference in dying next turn or living long enough to get off a game-winning Feedbomb chain; any ally you sacrifice for life to Conversion also adds another 2 life to the effect of your Soul Reaper, later; a wonderful way of benefitting one more time from a disabled ally that was already essentially dead to you. 

Soul Reaper
Its primary benefit is the obvious: a huge boost in life, late in the game; its secondary benefit may not be as readily apparent: setting up Eternal Renewal to only put "power" cards back into your deck, mid to late game. 




Board Control - At the heart of a deck named Total Control, is the ability to absolutely dominate the state of the board at any phase of the game. Between ZalBlast (and supporting Shadow Font), Sliver of Shadow, Death Mage ping, supporting ally damage, and Mind Control, there is absolutely no reason you should ever get overrun with this deck, even by an aggressive rush-style deck. Some have suggested Energy Discharge, but with the control measure already available in this deck, if you find yourself in need of something like Energy Discharge, either you have had a TERRIBLE draw and your opponent a good one, or you're playing the deck wrong / making poor sacrifice choices during the early stages of the game. 

Mind Control
Without dispute, the most powerful unilateral ally removal ability in all of Shadow Era. For (5), you can remove ANY ally from the board, AND deal damage to your opponent. It's like a non-limited Now You're Mine! + Fireball, all for the nice, tidy sum of (5). Anything you cannot ZalBlast/attack/ping to death, you can remove with Mind Control. It's one of those cards you should never sacrifice, unless it is a VERY tough situation and doing so will make a huge difference in the game. It's just that good.

Shadow Font
When played in a Zaladar deck, Shadow Font can be viewed, effectively, as Lightning Strike. It can kill off two smaller allies, kill off one and damage your enemy's hero, or set either one or two allies up for death by attack/ping damage. It is an invaluable tool for keeping the board clear, and can be used to set up the timing for a Sliver of Shadow. Also, on a round where you don't have targets for your ZalBlast to be effective, Shadow Font is better than Lightning Strike, as you can "store" the ability this turn to use later.

Sliver of Shadow
This is an excellent adjunct to ZalBlast, and should, in most cases, be played immediately following one, so as to not actually cost any Shadow Energy. It allows an extra, sudden 2 damage to kill an ally, or to kill off the enemy hero.

Ley Line Nexus
Originally, the deck had no item destruction in it, but after facing Spelleater Bands one time, I realized the inherent flaw in this philosophy. Spelleater Bands is not a commonly faced armor, but when you do, it can absolutely ruin this deck. Also, other notable armors such as Snow Sapphire and Crescendo can pose problems, as well as weapons such as Anklebreaker and Soul Seeker, make the inclusion of Ley Line Nexus a vital choice. If I am teching against specific decks, this may go up to as many as 4x copies, to ensure I can sacrifice one drawn in my opening hand.




Acceleration - These cards contribute to the core of the deck, Feedbombing. See my post made 06-06-2012 for more details on Feedbombing effectively.

Feedback
This card is primarily to fuel Feedbombs; however, it is very useful as a simple accelerator from turns 5-7, where it can be used to play an ally as well as a power card, such as Mind Control. For example, on turn 6, you can use a ZalBlast on Aldon and Puwen, killing Puwen and weakening Aldon; then play a Death Mage to finish off Aldon, play Feedback, and use the subsequent resources to play Mind Control on your opponent't Jasmine - a very powerful swing of the board for turn 6. It is highly advisable to never sacrifice one of these. Important point to keep in your mind as you do calculations for playing this card. Operate under the assumption that you have your number of resources MINUS (3), as you'll need that final three to play the Feedback, regardless of what you do afterwards. So, if you have 7 resources, and plan on using Feedback during your turn, your pre-Feedback plays must be limited to (4) or less cost(s). It is very frustrating to have 7 resources, Feedback, Mind Control, and other assorted cards in hand, and play the Mind Control at the beginning of your turn, thinking you'll be able to free up the rest of your hand with the Feedback. Whereas, if you'd done it in the correct order (ie Fire Snake, Gargoyle, Feedback, Mind Control, then Brutalis) you could have played out your entire hand, insteady of Mind Control and Brutalis being your turn.

Eternal Renewal
There are 2x of this card to mitigate the problems with only 1 copy, such as drawing it on your opening hand, despite its general lack of usefulness until much later in the game. In addition to simply keeping you from running out of cards, all of the "power" cards you've played thusfar are put back into your deck, increasing its potency, and the overall chances of pulling off an enormous Feedbomb chain soon thereafter. If you can play Soul Reaper immediately before Eternal Renewal, this only amplifies the above point.

Bazaar
Since Elementals lack unilater drawing power, the need to feed this monster falls on Bazaar as its primary source of steady card drawing. Against any hero/faction with the common ability to destroy Bazaar, you should not sacrifice any if at all possible, even once you already have one in play. You will find, over time, that games you do not not draw a Bazaar fairly early, or that you are consistently left without one due to their destruction, are games which are a difficult, uphill battle. Most games you will lose will be tied to a lack of drawing power. Normally, Bazaar is not seen as an effective draw engine, because it benefits your opponent as much, if not slightly more, than you. With ZTC, however, this is not the case. Early in the game, the 2 cards per turn are invaluable for making your sacrifice choices manageable. Later in the game, the constant flow of cards ensures you keep a handful of your "power" cards, which, pound for pound, are almost always stronger than those that your opponent will be drawing from Bazaar. Add in the element of the Feedbomb, and it doesn't matter than your opponent draws extra cards, as you'll be able to do far more with your cards/resources than they will.

Bad Santa
Its primary purpose is to fuel Feedbombs (Feedbomb being a portmanteau of Feedback and Santa Bomb). It can be used on turn 2, following a Fire Snake, if you did not get a Bazaar in your opening hand. This will help you draw a Bazaar to have for the following turn 3 or 4, depending on what other (3) cards you have in your hand. While sacrificing one of these, early on, is probably okay, it is not the first choice, and is usually detrimental to the overall flow of the deck to do so. The more of these you can get into your graveyard, and not your resource pile, the more will come back to your deck when you play an Eternal Renewal later on.

Well, as the title suggests, this is a breakdown of the strengths, weaknesses and abilities of my favourite hero in the game, Zaladar. This isn’t going to be a quick overview and run down of cards, this is going to be an in-depth strategic look at how to best use Zaladar and the core concepts behind him. I will be referencing Call of the Crystals [CotC] and Dark Prophecies [DP] in this article and strategies for each. So without further ado let’s get started.

Overview

As many of you are probably aware, Zaladar is an incredibly flexible hero, which is the primary reason I love him so much. This is in no small part due to his ability. Unlike every other ability in this game bar Banebow, it can directly target the hero, an ally, hero + ally, or two allies, and is completely unconditional (does not require a weapon, ally, etc) besides the SE cost. That in itself puts Zaladar head and shoulders above pretty much all others in terms of flexibility.

However, Zaladar also has access to the Elemental card pool which is widely regarded (in CotC at least) as one of the best in the game. He has access to reliable single creature removal (Mind Control), a board wipe (Energy Discharge), healing (Conversion, Soul Reaper), buffing (Life Infusion, Shard of Power), and resource manipulation (Feedback). Factor in Dark Prophecies and you also have access to mill (Temporal Disturbance), a plethora of allies (Flare, Zantonite, Xar Modulator, Crystal Titan), SE manipulation (Interference, Crystal Titan), and most importantly a draw engine (Antimatter). Basically with the Elemental and by extension the Shadow card pools there is nothing Zaladar cannot do with some degree of effectiveness.

Allies

Zaladar, in addition to his Elemental class allies, also has access to the Shadow pool of allies. This provides some excellent choices for Zaladar, as many of these allies promise high durability, which is useful so that allies can survive to combine with Zaladar’s ability. I’ve highlighted some of the core choices that usually make themselves home in a Zaladar deck:

Call of the Crystals

    Infernal Gargoyle: The 4 x auto-include. Even after Dark Prophecies there is no 3cc with greater survivability, even though others are definitely aiming for the crown. Gargoyle is almost always guaranteed to stick around for at least a turn, most times two, and that is a massive boon for Zaladar.

    Brutalis: The most survivable 2 drop in the majority of cases. I say this because now it has a competitor, Ironhide Karash. Versus mages, Zaladar mirror and Banebow, Brutalis is definitely the stronger of the two, however Karash can really make his presence felt against ally based decks. Use Brut much like Gargoyle, ping damage combined with Zaladar’s ability. Unfortunately his measly attack damage of 1 is somewhat of a deficiency in the fledgling DP meta, more 5 health allies roaming around means he can’t combo up to lethal damage. But he is still a core addition to Zaladar.

    Death Mage Thaddeus: Like the others, he is used to combine damage sources. However he does not need to survive at all to be useful. A fantastic tool for taking back the board. However he also suffers from the Brutalis syndrome in DP, sometimes not being enough to deal the final ping.


Dark Prophecies

    Ironhide Karash: The rookie card, the first draft pick from the new set for Shadow heroes. Karash’s damage reduction makes him insanely dangerous to some heroes, though his low health means he’s vulnerable to others. Most importantly however is that he has 2 attack, meaning he can combine with Zaladar for 5 damage. This is very important in the DP meta as I have mentioned before.

    Morbid Acolyte: This card is made for Zaladar. Not only is he 5 health and thus has massive survivability, his ability means that Zaladar’s number one nemesis, the pesky Gargoyle, is a threat no longer. The alternate 3cc drop for sure, and adding 2 or 3 of these to your deck will mean you have an incredibly consistent opening.

    Death Collector: Another solid alternate 3cc, this card has the ability to become a beast if left alone for a couple of turns. However he has more uses than that as his ability equates to graveyard manipulation, which means he can really put the hurt on Gravebone, shut down Shadow Knight loops, hurt other Death Collectors and Rotlings. Not to mention he can also shut down abilities like Soul Reaper and Infinity Core, or at least render them less effective.

    Darkwood Wraith: The Wraith is control, and is another way to deal with the deadly Gargoyle. He also provides Shadow with a Retreat effect, something they were sorely lacking in CotC. But his real benefit is flexibility. Wraith can also be used on your allies, bouncing back damaged, crippled or disabled allies, or allies with effects (like DMT, and even Twisted Familiar). He can also be used in concert with cards like Super Focus and Synchronicity.

    Furrion Terror: His on summon ability means that combined with Zaladar’s ability two allies on the board can take 5 damage, enough to kill most things in this game. Not to mention the Terror has a capable attack by himself. However his true strength is his board wiping ability.











    Abilities and Items

    So many choices here and so many that can swing a game in your favour. There are also so many options for catering to different playstyles. Here are some cards that have tremendous synergy with Zaladaricon:

    Call of the Crystals

        Shadow Fonticon: The NUMBER ONE ability for Zaladar. In his hands this is no different to the mage card Lightning Strikeicon, and we all know how powerful that is. Honestly I can never think of a time when this is not a useful card.

        Mind Control: Probably the most feared card in the Elemental pool, and with good reason. No ally is safe from this card. However this card has drawbacks that most people are not aware of. First thing is that it is 5cc to kill a single ally, which means it’s usually the only card played in a turn until late game, which costs huge amounts of tempo and means if you’re behind it won’t help you get control of the game back. (I will quite often bait Elemental players with a juicy MC target to put them behind on the tempo game.) Secondly is that in terms of resources it’s almost always a negative trade or even at best, unless you’re targeting a 6 cost ally. This is a card to help you keep board control. Also the psychological aspects of this card cannot be ignored.

        Here Be Monsters: Made famous by Fou DeLile in his Here Be Zaladar deck, HBM allows you to keep your opponent down for a turn or two, and forces them to resource more than you, generating card advantage and resource advantage. It also counters the major weakness of Elementals, draw, by forcing your opponent to use up their cards and get them closer to the dreaded “top-decking” state. It also doesn’t cost you a lot of tempo, because you have Zaladar’s ability to control the board in early game.

        Soul Reapericon: Quite a useful card to keep you in the game until you can deal those last few points of damage, especially if you are running an aggro beatdown Zaladar with lots of small cheap allies as they will provide a great deal of fuel for Soul Reaper. Play Eternal Renewalicon after this to get back all your powerful abilities and weapons without diluting the mix with cheap allies.

        Dimension Ripper: Zaladar’s number one weapon and one of the main reasons mages fear him so. This allows him to boost his damage potential significantly, and steal cards from your opponent. Sure you give away a card as well, but it’s best to think in terms of what you stand to gain, rather than what you’ve lost. You can also mitigate this loss with clever use of Bad Santaicon. Also do not forget an important part of this card, disruption. By stealing your opponents cards you’re disrupting their strategy, whereas you are able to build your deck around the expectation you will be giving cards away.


    Dark Prophecies

        Super Focus: This card is incredible, and the bane of Warriors and Wulven everywhere. This thing not only boosts your allies, it shuts down crippling effects and allows them to get back in the fight. This card encourages lots of dirty tricks and synergizes well with cards like Darkwood Wraith, Sacrifical Lamb, Conversionicon and Synchronicity just to name a few. While I feel it’s probably more Elementalisicon’ domain, this card is still very much at home with Zaladar.

        Infinity Core: Of all Zaladar’s new toys, this is probably the one that’s getting the most exposure. It’s an anti-milling, graveyard manipulating, healing powerhouse, and all for 2 resources. A very powerful card that is offset by the tempo loss of casting it and using its ability. It has some synergy with Antimatter, but is a very expensive combo to pull off.

        Contaminated Water: Reducing enemy allies by 1 health is a big thing for Zaladar, putting a lot of allies into kill range with his ability alone. It also makes Gargoyle more manageable. The downside of it is that your opponent can destroy it by spending 3SE. But truthfully, that’s not much of a downside as you’ve just delayed their ability by 3 turns.

        Interference: An alternate Shadow Font that carries considerable risk, yet amazing reward. It can be fantastic against some heroes, yet useless against many others (3SE heroes mostly). It also loses a lot of potency if you go first. However it does work beautifully in concert with the next card….

        Shadowvein: This thing is a beast. An alternative to Ripper and it actually makes semi-solo Zaladar viable. This card can cause you to gain SE at a phenomenal rate, and combined with Interference can delay your opponent from reaping the benefits. But there are some heroes you should not use this on, the number one in this case is Zhannaicon (she will out heal your damage) followed closely by Moonstalker (You won’t get to attack him ever again). Banebow is also a definite no-no unless you’ve stopped casting allies.

        Morphic Armor: This card is Zaladar’s ace in the hole. You may be wondering why, it’s a huge SE sink and prevents you from maximizing your ability. The reason is simple; it is the bane of Zaladar’s bad matchups. Think about who gives him real trouble, Ambericon, Gwen, Darkclawicon, Banebow. Three of those four rely on attachments to carry the day. Morphic Armor changes all that, stealing them away for good. Now you might think Sever Ties is a good alternative, but ST doesn’t give YOU the benefit of said attachments. Think Shadowvein with Rapid Fire or Speedstrike, or the draw of Blood Frenzy and the health of Enrageicon or Lone Wolficon, or crippling your opponent’s allies while simultaneously freeing up your own (HUGE TEMPO SWING). That alone makes it worth including. And with the increased prevalence of attachments in DP there are a lot more strategies you can disrupt with this card.











Draw, and the Problems Therein

Alright, now we come to the main problem that Elementals have had since day one which has now only been partially addressed in Dark Prophecies, the issues around reliable draw. Currently in CotC Elemental decks have had to cobble together an effective draw mechanic through one-shot cards (Bad Santa, Sacrificial Lamb) and cantrips (Here Be Monsters, Ley Line Nexus). Truthfully this isn’t so bad at all, and at least one of my DP decks still does this simply because it doesn’t cost you much tempo and played properly you can still generate significant card advantage. However there is a shiny new tool, Antimatter. So let’s take a look at it.

Antimatter costs 2 to put into play and 3 to use, drawing two cards. But here’s the kicker, you have to discard one of the two cards you draw. Some people say that’s awesome and allows lots of neat tricks, some people (like myself) see it as a drawback that needs to be mitigated with graveyard retrieval, which means you start to build your deck around the concept of making your draw engine work, where it should be the other way around (draw should power the deck, not deck power the draw). You can ignore the discard, and in many cases it’s not a difficult decision to choose what to lose, but what happens if you get two Mind Controls? Or a Mind Control and a Shadow Font? That being said, it is a constant draw engine, just a very costly one, and you need to be acutely aware of it at all times.

Playstyles

Okay, now that we’ve looked at some of the cards Zaladar has access to (not all, there are just too many to go through), let’s start looking at the ways to play him. To do that we need to look at archetypes in general firstly, so we should all know that there are three main playstyles available in Shadow Era currently:

    Aggro: Also what I refer to as beatdown. You’re the aggressor, the proactive player aiming to force responses from your opponent. You hit fast and often. This sort of playstyle generally uses a lot of allies and/or weapons/direct damage. Aggro is a style of play that relies heavily on maintaining tempo. Mess that up and chances are you can overrun an aggro deck.

    Control: The flip side to aggro, control aims to win by being reactive, constantly having the right answer until it’s ready to produce threats of its own. Control doesn’t so much rely on the tempo play, it’s more reliant on card advantage for the majority of the game.

    Stall/Mill: The ultimate slowdown. We all know the main culprit here (Millstalker), though there are other stall decks around of varying levels of effectiveness. While these decks claim to win by decking you out (milling) they’re actually stalling you, milling is just a by-product of that.


Now what category does Zaladar fit into? Well, he can do all three, but he is most effective in the aggro/beatdown role, and most decks are built to exploit this. However he can be used in the other styles with varying degrees of effectiveness. Some of the card choices for each style could be:

    Aggro: 4-6 2cc allies, 7-10 3cc allies, 2-3 5cc+ allies, Shadow Font, Mind Control, Weapon, Interference, Bad Santa, Super Focus

    Control: 4 2cc allies, 6-8 3cc allies, 4-6 5cc+ allies, Shadow Font, Interference, Mind Control, Energy Discharge, Infinity Core, Eternal Renewal, Soul Reaper, Armor of Ages, Morphic Armor, Synchronicity, Antimatter

    Stall/Mill: Bazaar, Bad Santa, Temporal Disturbance, Evil Ascendant, Contaminated Water, Furrion Terror, Shadow Knight, Infinity Core, Soul Reaper, Armor of Ages, Shadow Font, Interference, Mind Control


Bear in mind these are hardly exhaustive and are created considering my own personal preferences.

Matchups

Okay, this is the meat and potatoes of this article, going through the heroes and discussing the quality of matchup and what needs to be done to beat them, based on current meta decks. For the purposes of this article I will be using a traditional Zaladar beatdown as a base deck, nothing special here:

1 x Zaladar

4 x Brutalis
4 x Gargoyle
2 x Bad Wolf
4 x Death Mage Thaddeus
3 x Plasma Behemoth

4 x Mind Control
2 x Shriek
4 x Shadow Font
3 x Sacrificial Lamb
4 x Bad Santa
2 x Ley Line Nexus
3 x Dimension Ripper

Total 39 cards + Hero

Some of you may recognise this as my Crystal Miner deck. There are no DP cards in it; however I will be discussing DP options as we go through. 












Boris Skullcrusher
Matchup Quality: Medium
Tactics: Boris likes his fat allies, so hold onto your Mind Controls. Keep the board locked down at all times, because he will be outdrawing you and if you let him get down some allies you can’t deal with it’s all over. His ability is very annoying but if you can get a Behemoth to stick you should be fine. Hold onto a Ley Line Nexus for the inevitable King's Pride.

Amber Rain
Matchup Quality: Hard-Very Hard
Tactics: Ugh. Weapons. Zaladar hates weapons, because they’re a damage source he has trouble controlling. Coupled with the draw power of a Warrior and you’re in for a hard fight. Behemoth mitigates this matchup somewhat, but other options are obviously Sever Ties and Morphic Armor if you hit a lot of Ambers. She is beatable, but not an easy win by any stretch.

Do not be afraid to use Bad Santas as often as you can because with Blood Frenzy, there’s a very good chance you’ll gain more cards than she will (this applies to all warriors).

Spam allies as rapidly as you can to overwhelm her. If you can get three uncrippled allies on the board you’ve got the match in many cases.

Victor Heartstriker
Matchup Quality: Medium
Tactics: Victor is annoying but most certainly beatable, even if it doesn’t feel like it. He’s much easier to take down in DP with the inclusion of Shadowvein, as you can get him down to about 12 life then swap to a solo route and use the power of Shadowvein to ensure you’re constantly blasting away. Don’t expect any heavy allies to live long, concentrate instead on streams of cheap allies to overwhelm his defences. Victor likes high health allies for survivability, so you will have to combine damage sources to take them out.

Gwenneth Truesight
Matchup Quality: Very Hard
Tactics: This is as close to auto-loss as Zaladar gets. There is no easy route to defeating a tuned Gwen deck. Your best bet is distraction tactics. Drop as many allies with more than 4 health as possible (This includes Gargoyle) to keep her busy and counteract her Rapid Fire. Obviously Sever Ties and Morphic Armor will work wonders here to remove Rapid Fire and slow her down significantly. Also if you pack Armor of Ages you’ll prevent 24 damage and you can even use Infinity Core to try and keep up with her heal.

Nishaven
Matchup Quality: Easy-Medium
Tactics: With a built in board wipe that doesn’t hurt him, Nish is tougher than his feminine counterpart. However just keep up with the Gargoyles and the ability, and use Dimension Ripper whenever possible and he will fall just like Eladwen.

Watch out for Voltar’s Ring, it will ruin you if you don’t deal with it.

Eladwen Frostmire
Matchup Quality: Easy
Tactics: Honestly, I love facing Eladwen rush with Zaladar. Once you get past the first 3 turns you’re usually on top of it (even going second), unless she gets the God rush (Kris, Puwen, PotL, Aldon, etc). And once Dimension Ripper comes out you’re basically home free. An interesting thing with this matchup is that Mind Control is not really important, you should be fine with Shadow Font as Eladwen rush runs very few allies with more than 4 health.

Do hold a couple of Mind Control just in case there are some late game fatties (like Sandworms and Aeons).

Jericho Spellbane
Matchup Quality: Easy-Medium
Tactics: Zhanna without the heal. Get in early and hit hard, but don’t overextend. Keep three allies maximum on the board. Wait until the first Tidal Wave before you drop a heavier ally. Hold onto your mind controls to deal with the waves of Ravens and Aeons that all half decent Jericho decks should have. Kill his draw engine wherever possible. Even Plague builds aren’t that much trouble as most Zaladar builds can function quite happily on 3 resources, constantly dropping threats.

Zhanna Mist
Matchup Quality: Medium-Hard
Tactics: Basically your tactics are identical to Jericho, except you have a more difficult time because Zhanna can heal 3 damage every 3 turns. You really need to keep the pressure up and kill her before she gets a foothold. Believe me, Zaladar will run out of steam before Zhanna will, even with additional healing cards.

Lance Shadowstalker
Matchup Quality: Easy
Tactics: Zaladar is the perfect counter to a standard Lance strategy, mid game control and ramp up. Your early game is an order of magnitude better than his, and by the time the first Raven comes out you should be waiting with a Mind Control. Use Sac Lamb here for unilateral draw, as you WILL have crippled allies floating around. It’s not uncommon for me to walk away with wins while on 20+ health.

Canny opponents however can give you a tough time if they put out more weenies than you can handle (if you don’t have Energy Discharge). Priest of the Light is also very annoying in Lance builds.

Serena Thoughtripper
Matchup Quality: Easy-Medium
Tactics: Slightly more difficult than Lance, as she has the discard and the weapon based strategy. However she still has those squishy human allies and the weak early rogue game. Just hold onto Bad Santas and keep your hand as full as possible. Every extra card in your hand hurts the probability of you losing the one card you need significantly.

One: 100%
Two: 50%
Three: 33%
Four: 25%
Five: 20%

And so forth. 








Ter Adun
Matchup Quality: Easy
Tactics: Well in CotC Ter is generally a walk in the park. Solo strategies can give you trouble if they get a foothold, so don’t let that happen. In DP Ter is significantly stronger and will be able to fight for board from turn 5 onwards. So don’t give him the chance.

Logan Stonebreaker
Matchup Quality: Easy
Tactics: Basically your tactics here are identical to dealing with Ter Adun. However you will be losing an ally every four turns due to his ability, so be ready with more in your hand. Throw out lots of allies to beat down the weapon and to give him too many targets.

Banebow
Matchup Quality: Very Hard
Tactics: Banebow is the only hero with a better early game than you, and it hurts you bad. He would be the second toughest matchup for Zaladar behind Gwen, as he also has a good later game with Soul Seeker. And now with A Perfect Shot you can’t even fatty roll him reliably anymore. The best way to defeat him is to get in as much early damage as possible then switch to a solo route to prevent him from healing. Use Mind Control and Shadow Font like they’re going out of fashion, and ensure you’re constantly beating down with either Shadowvein or Dimension Ripper. He is winnable, but it’s not easy.

Baduruu
Matchup Quality: Medium
Tactics: Most Baduruu’s out there at the moment are Resource Destruction Baduruus and like I said versus a Plague priest deck, Zaladar can function at low resources if he has to. The problem with Baduruu is that he has Soul Seeker, and can really cause you problems because Ley Line Nexus is 5 resources, well beyond what he’ll let you get to. Gargoyles are the order of the day here, and Morbid Acolytes. If you can get a Death Collector to stick for a turn or two he will end Baduruu, so if you have them they should be a priority.

Majiya
Matchup Quality: Medium-Hard
Tactics: Normally mages don’t give you much trouble but Majiya is an exception, and it’s because she can spam Gargoyles and she has plenty of removal power and draw in the form of her ability. In addition, canny Majiya players will not be throwing out fat allies, they’ll be using lots of 3cc allies, and throwing them through Portals. A Gargoyle and a Bad Wolf do 5 damage for 6 resources, not much less efficient than a Shadow Knight and three times as difficult to remove. Dimension Ripper should be your primary focus here, because you want to disrupt her as much as possible. Also focus on having 2 Gargoyles out by Turn 4 if possible, to prevent her from wiping your board at that point. Always have two allies on the field if possible because she will have trouble keeping up without resorting to Supernova.

Gravebone
Matchup Quality: Easy
Tactics: What does Gravebone like? Fat allies. What does Zaladar like? Killing fat allies. Like the other mages, get in early and hit hard. Focus on Dimension Ripper if using it, if not Shadowvein is also an admirable choice, especially with Gravebone. Because you WANT him to keep bringing those big allies back, so you can keep Mind Controlling them. Watch out for Gargoyles as usual.

Elementalis
Matchup Quality: Medium
Tactics: Surprisingly Elementalis can give you problems in CotC. Without access to retreat those super buffed Gargoyles can really threaten you and you need to get in as much damage as quickly as possible to win it. In DP however, Darkwood Wraith is your best friend, and makes this matchup much easier. Do watch out for Energy Discharge, many Elementalis’ run it as they don’t have Zaladar’s control abilities.

Zaladar
Matchup Quality: Medium
Tactics: Mirror matches are all about who gets the most Gargoyles out. If you can get more than your opponent, they’ll stick longer and they’ll do more damage. Don’t be afraid to use Dimension Ripper, it’s almost like drawing from your own deck. Grind them down one point of damage at a time, but always concentrate on the board. Remember Zaladar is not great at staging comebacks, so if you can get him down you’re looking good. Likewise if you find yourself in a losing position you’re in trouble.

Darkclaw
Matchup Quality: Hard-Very Hard
Tactics: Solo Darkclaw is very tough for Zaladar to overcome. Hold your Shrieks, but only use one on What Big Teeth, save the other for the Full Moon or Rain Delay, build up your forces as best you can and go for the omega strike. Once again Sever Ties and Morphic Armor will win you games here.

Allied Claw is easier but still a difficult fight, particularly if they have Blood Moon.

Moonstalker
Matchup Quality: Medium-Hard
Tactics: Moon is one of those heroes that ramps up. You may look like you’re going strong, but then he’ll hide for four-five turns and before long you’re looking squarely at defeat. DO NOT SACRIFICE MIND CONTROL EVER. Hold them as you can be sure there will be a stream of fat allies from turn 5 onward. Use Zaladar’s ability on the hero at all times. Rely on DMT and Plasma Behemoth to do most of the damage, and try and use DMT to draw out the Captured Preys if possible.

Stupidly, Millstalker is easier. One DMT will counteract Lone Wolf completely, Plasma Behemoth will really bring the hurt. Also Molten Destroyer is a very good prospect as each one is good for 5 guaranteed damage when EA is out. Build up your forces and Shriek that Full Moon for the final blow.

Nasty trick for Millstalker, when he goes into the SK loop, don't kill them outright, but use your ability to drop the Knight to 1. EA will take him out on the Millstalker's turn AND it'll negate the Lone Wolf heal, because SK was alive at the beginning of the turn.

Conclusion

So that concludes this epic post. I hope it helped all you aspiring Zaladar players out there get a feel for this incredibly flexible and dangerous hero. If you’re not a Zaladar player, you’ve just gotten an insight into what a Zaladar player is thinking when he comes up against your favourite hero. 










			1.1.1.3 1.5 Zaladar - “Crystal Miner" 

				1.1.1.3.1 “Crystal Miner 2.0” 


http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?18288-3000th-Post-%96-1-5-Zaladar-%93Crystal-Miner-2-0%94

3000th Post – 1.5 Zaladar - “Crystal Miner 2.0”

    Hi guys,

    I just noticed I have hit 3000 posts! Anyways, I figure I’d post my latest and greatest iteration of my Zaladar “Crystal Miner” deck, version 2.0. I feel it’s actually different enough to warrant its own thread, and I needed something cool for 3000 posts, so this is it.

    1 x Zaladar

    4 x Brutalis
    4 x Gargoyle
    2 x Bad Wolf
    4 x Death Mage Thaddeus
    3 x Plasma Behemoth

    4 x Mind Control
    2 x Shriek
    4 x Shadow Font
    3 x Sacrificial Lamb
    4 x Bad Santa
    2 x Ley Line Nexus
    3 x Dimension Ripper

    Total 39 cards + Hero

    This is tuned to a RAZOR edge. I’ve mentioned that a modified Crystal Miner took me to 323 in the rankings. This is it. There is no true auto loss matchups, only (very) difficult matchups (I have beaten Gwen with this deck, Millstalker too.)

    The function of the deck is very similar to the original Crystal Miner; however Behemoth adds a slightly different flavour, and is insanely useful against Moonstalker (both variants). For a more complex breakdown of the cards you can refer to my original “Crystal Miner” deck here.

    However, some of the changes:

    More 3cc Allies

    My original deck had 7 3cc allies, this one has 10. I’ve yet to be without a 3cc ally using this. Sometimes I do run +1 Bad Wolf -1 DMT, however I do prefer this version. If you don’t have a cast-able ally of some kind by turn 3 your name is probably Bad Luck Brian.

    Plasma Behemoth

    We could argue this point all day, in fact there was discussion on the first Crystal Miner thread about it (And I argued in favour of Molten at that point, due to resource costs). However in the current meta and the increased possibility of Millstalker, this is now a no brainer for me. It is also so dangerous your opponent just can’t leave it on the board. Plonking these down in front of Gwen will mean that she has to use both Soul Seeker strikes to kill it, negating the heal (Behemoth deals 3 retaliation damage) AND her Rapid Fire in one! Rest assured throwing Behemoths to the wolves has won me games vs Gwen. Plus it’s almost always a 2-for-1 card to remove it anyway.

    Only 3 Ripper?

    Yep, I found I was saccing it too often to warrant a full set. I used the extra spot to boost my Sacrificial Lamb count to 3, as disabling effects are very widespread currently (Elad’s freeze, Anklebreaker, Crippling Blow, Captured Prey for example. Even Poison Arrow).

    Anyway, that’s my latest Zal. Enjoy guys! 


				1.1.1.3.2 3.0
Zaladar – Crystal Miner 3.0
Hi all,

Here’s my Zaladar deck that got my ETC Preybird account over 300. It’s a reiteration of an old classic, with a few changes and some new tricks.

Zaladar

2 x Brutalis
3 x Ironhide Karash
4 x Infernal Gargoyle
2 x Morbid Acolyte
3 x Death Mage Thaddeus
3 x Darkwood Wraith

4 x Mind Control
4 x Shadow Font

2 x Shriek of Vengeance
2 x Ley Line Nexus

4 x Bad Santa
2 x Antimatter

3 x Shadowvein
2 x Morphic Armor

40 cards + hero

Interesting ally split….

It is, and it works. For 2cc, everyone knows the value of Karash, but sometimes his low health just doesn’t cut it (Mages, Banebow, Amber), so Brutalis is in there to provide a cheap effective tank should I need it. Besides, he’s still got his use in conjunction with Zaladar’s ability, though he sometimes needs some help in DMT to take down those 5 health allies (but that’s nothing really new).

In regards to the 3cc, Gargoyle is still a 4 x auto-include in my books, even though Morbid’s ability is just so damn good. This means that Morbid is at 2, and you just can’t throw them at the enemy. You need to time them to make sure they’ll survive to do their job, cutting through stealth and protector, preventing TO draw, etc. Morbid will win you the game against Moonstalker in particular, so be sure to keep him in your hand. There’s only 3 DMT because that 1 damage isn’t as effective as it used to be, and I’d rather the space for another 2 attack ally.

For the sole 5cc in the deck I’ve put Wraith. The reason being is that he controls one of Zal’s great nemeses, Gargoyle. He’s also great at preventing people from dropping hordes, and forces your opponent to come at you in a more piecemeal manner. The other thing is that he allows you to bounce your own crippled and disabled allies. Wraith is worth his salt and then some in this deck, and while he’s not the most aggressive ally out there, he can hold the board down and let your other damage sources do their job. You could use Furrion Terror here, but I find the Wraith just has so much utility I can’t go past it. (It also ruins Elementalis singlehandedly.)

Antimatter?

Yeah my earlier versions didn’t use it, but I can’t look past a permanent engine at the moment, particularly as I don’t have as much incidental draw in CM3 (no Ripper). However it’s still a massive tempo loss and that discard hurts, so it’s a secondary draw. I may only trigger it a couple of times a game, mostly relying on Bad Santa for my draw instead. Sacrifical Lamb also isn’t as useful here because I can reactivate my crippled allies with either Wraith or Morphic Armor.

Morphic Armor?

This card is incredible. It wins you games with Zaladar, simply because it messes with his bad matchups (bar Banebow) so much. Steal Blood Frenzy, Enrage, Rampage, Lone Wolf, Speedstrike, Rapid Fire, bounce crippling attachments, and generally wreak havoc. Its high SE cost is completely offset by the tempo gain. Sometimes I’ll intentionally leave crippled allies lying around as a ‘bank’ of sorts  It does hurt your ability use a bit, but that’s where the next card comes in….

Shadowvein

The Ripper replacement. This thing is great in some matchups, less awesome in others (DO NOT USE AGAINST ZHANNA OR GWEN). Allows you to gain SE at a phenomenal rate and will win you games, despite accelerating your opponent in a similar manner. The best counter to your opponent’s gain is to simply not give their ability any targets (no allies in many cases). With Shadowvein and a couple of Mind Controls you can usually go solo and get the win anyway.

Conclusion

Well, that’s my Zaladar. It’s a nice straight forward evolution of Crystal Miner and it hits hard and fast, and gains you plenty of SE. Which is good, because you burn through it! So it lives up to its name a lot more than previous versions.

				1.1.1.3.3
			1.1.1.4 1.5 Here Be Zaladar 
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?16112-1-5-Here-Be-Zaladar
This is the deck I played in 7 of my 8 rounds of World Championships qualifiers. It went 13-1 (only The Haydes managed to grab a game from it). I also brought it to the Grand Finals (see post #2 for more details).

Much like when someone uses your own hand to slap your face, this deck is annoying. Much like your girlfriend, it can do two things at once: control you and drain your lifeforce. Much like your relationship, it’s a gruelling attrition war. But this time, you’ll be the one with your head held high when the dust settles.

One thing is certain. It’s not gonna be pretty.

Here Be Zaladar:

1x Zaladar

4x Brutalis
1x Dark Flayer
4x Infernal Gargoyle
4x Death Mage Thaddeus
4x Molten Destroyer
3x Shadow Knight

3x Sacrificial Lamb
4x Here Be Monsters
4x Shadow Font
4x Mind Control

2x Shriek of Vengeance
2x Ley Line Nexus

The Set-Up (going first)
Your best start is Brutalis (or Dark Flayer if playing a Human opponent) followed by Gargoyle (DMT can work but is best saved to use simultaneously with your ability). From there, you have many plays to build on your board presence.

T4 Gargoyle to back the first one can be real though for some classes to handle (Rogues, Amber, Zaladar). DMT can combine with Brute and Garg to kill 4hp allies. Against classes with board wipes, you can fake an overextension only to hit them with HBM on T5 (skip a resource) and prevent them from clearing the board. Same thing applies to Rogues, prevent that Raven/Anklebreaker.

T4 Shadow Font will allow you to clear the board and prevent the annoying Jasmine/Aldon combo or Priest of the Light.

T4 Here Be Monsters (skip a resource) will slow down your opponent and even out card advantage. If you have a DMT in hand to use on T5 in conjunction with your ability, it's a good play versus Humans.

The Set-Up (going second)
The T2 Brutalis is crucial here. Dark Flayer will work well against human but is quite risky against Shadow. You're not doomed if your 2drop-less but things are gonna be a bit darker.

T3 HBM everytime you can. At first I forced myself to do it against my better logic, but you'd be surprised how many suboptimal play you can force with this move. Backed up by a Brute on the field, DMT in your hand, and Zal's ability, you can take back the board next turn with card and resource advantage. Keep a Shadow Font nearby if you expect PotLs or Gargoyles.

T4 Apart from the aforementioned DMT + ability, a second HBM can devastate slower builds if they skipped their turn 4 or played non-allies. As when going first, if you can swarm your opponent with Brute + 2 3cc allies while he has trouble setting up, you should also seize the opportunity.

The Storm
From T5 onwards, the proverbial storm can start. Mind Control, Molten Destroyer, Shadow Font and Zal’s ability make it so that very few turns pass without the opposing Hero taking a point of damage or three. If you managed to keep a Gargoyle or DMT on the field, it will be almost impossible for your opponent to keep an ally on the board.

If your opponent has board wiping capacities, always try to force it out him with a Molten Destroyer in your hand (a Shadow Knight will do too). If he relies on crippling effects, play as many bodies as you can.

If you’re ahead (let’s say, you have the only ally on the board, opponent can’t use his ability next turn), HBM can choke your opponent, and prevent him from striking back with his best tools.

Shadow Knights and Molten Destroyers are only decoys really. If you get to attack with one of them, you probably just won right then and there. Most of the time, they are there to buy you time, weaken Heroes and allies, while your real damage dealers (Mind Control, Shadow Font, Brute, Garg and DMT) go to work.

Ley Line Nexus is mainly used late game to seal the deal. Watch out for Spelleater Bands.

The Kill
By the late game, you will most likely start to get outdrawn so at some point, you will have to go for the throat. You will rarely get a clean kill (no opposing allies on the board), but there’s no point for style here..

When your opponent’s around 10-12 HP, start counting. With 2-3 damage from allies, 3 from your ability, 3 from a Shadow Font and 3 from a Mind Control you win. It will most likely take two, maybe even three turns since you will be on low resources (5-6, maybe 7), but there isn’t a whole lot your opponent can do during that time. He’ll probably target your allies first, buying an extra turn to draw direct damage, and will then need to play allies, which you will use against him.

Sacrificial Lamb can be great here, as you’re surrendering board control anyway, you can use your allies to dig for Shadow Fonts, Mind Controls or DMTs.

A lot of games end with both players watching Zaladar’s Shadow Energy counter slowly tick up, knowing that the game has already been decided.

Matchups
Humans don’t stand much of a chance. Blood Frenzy is the one card you can’t really counter, but the HP drain plays in your plan anyway. Keep Sacrificial Lambs to “free” your crippled allies.

Against Lance, play an ally a turn and prosper. MC Raven. Sacrifice crippled allies. I rarely use LLN on Anklebreaker, unless I’m already ahead. I’d rather play my weenies. Spelleater bands can save Lance’s ass and spark a comeback so be vigilant.

Shadow Knights and Mind Controls will beat Zhanna.

Gwen is the one auto-loss. Soul Seeker pretty much counters this deck. Banebow is also very hard.

Moonstalker with Shadow Font will also beat you often.

Majiya will be close, no doubt about it. Molten Destroyer will shine here, taking out precious HP points one by one.

Gargoyles are the most annoying card in the set (Sandworms come in to late to be much of a nuisance).

Try to hit draw engines with Shriek when you have an opportunity. With HBM in the deck, the cost of Shrieks is somewhat lessened.

That's it for now. Ask, comment, flame but most importantly GLHF! 

			1.1.1.5  Eternal Font [1.603] 
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?17636-Eternal-Font-1-603

 Cool Eternal Font [1.603]

    This is a build I have been using recently based on BlanketEffect's ZTC 3.0 - The Feedbomb Dynamo.

    Current Deck (40):

    4 x Infernal Gargoyle
    3 x Fire Snake
    4 x Death Mage Thaddeus
    (11 allies)

    1 x Energy Discharge
    1 x Soul Reaper
    4 x Mind Control
    4 x Feedback
    2 x Eternal Renewal
    4 x Shadow Font
    4 x Sacrificial Lamb
    4 x Bad Santa
    (24 abilities)

    4 x Bazaar
    (4 items)

    There is already quite a bit of discussion on ZTC which I recommend reading before trying a feedbomb style build.

    The opening is crucial and where the game is won and lost. Having to resource crucial cards to prevent too many allies hitting the board can be impossible to overthrow. This is the only situation which Energy Discharge can provide a last chance to come back. Soul Reaper is not only important in some matches where healing is needed, but to remove allies from your graveyard before renewing it to your draw pile to more easily reuse Shadow Font, Mind Control, Bad Santa, and Feedback.

    Most of your damage comes from Zaladar's ability and your opponents allies, so you will want to target the hero when using Zaladar's ability at every stage and use Feedback, draw, allies, and Mind Control to keep the opponents allies to a minimum. The biggest struggle is against decks that can destroy Bazaar which should go out as soon as possible.

			1.1.1.6 Cool Zaladar the Glutton [1.503]
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?14403-Zaladar-the-Glutton-1-503

    I haven't been going through the topics here yet so it's entirely possible that this deck uses a similar strategy from other players as it's not very complicated being my first attempt at a 1.503 death-race deck.

    Current Deck (40 cards):
    1 x Zaladar

    4 x Keldor
    4 x Infernal Gargoyle
    4 x Brutalis
    4 x Death Mage Thaddeus
    2 x Ogloth the Glutton
    (18 allies)

    2 x Soul Reaper
    4 x Mind Control
    4 x Shadow Font
    4 x Sacrificial Lamb
    2 x Shriek of Vengeance
    2 x Ley Line Nexus
    (18 abilities)

    3 x Dimension Ripper
    (3 x items)

    The deck started with a full compliment of Shadow Knights and Molten Destroyers, but these fast became my early draw auto resource, and were not working very well late game and getting in the way of better combos that were replaced by Keldor and Sacrificial Lamb. The deck can happily sit on 3/4/5 resources for a few turns with better control.

    The concept is pretty simple being a death-race deck based around board control. There are a couple of strategies that are worth explaining which relies on a great synergy Zaladar has on T4 with Brutalis, Keldor, Sacrificial Lamb, Shadow Font, and Death Mage Thaddeus.

    T2 Brutalis
    T3 Keldor
    T4 Keldor ability + Sacrificail Lamb on Keldor

    This combo is particularly effective against human opponents as a buffed Keldor can kill any T3 human ally, and can draw Mind Control to keep fatties at bay. Whilst Infernal Gargoyle or Death Mage Thaddeus can be a better choice for Shadow Heroes depending on what is on the board with Brutalis. Without drawing a Sacrificial Lamb before T3 Keldor can be resourced unless no other 3 cost ally is drawn.

    There are also the other usual control combinations at Zaladar's disposal.

    Mind Control is never sacrificed unless the opponent's deck is identified as a solo deck. Shadow Font is another card that should be resourced very rarely.

			1.1.1.7  Zaladar Ripper Control - for 1.5

    Hi everyone. I've had some decent success with this deck awhile ago, hitting a max of 349 rating before switching to other decks. Concept-wise its focused on dealing consistent damage to your opponent every turn while minimising his damage output. I'd like to list it out to see if there's any ways to further improve on this deck's performance by tweaking it further.

    Zaladar

    4 x Brutalis
    4 x Infernal Gargoyle
    3 x Death Mage
    3 x Molten Destroyer
    3 x Wulven Tracker

    4 x Mind Control
    2 x Shriek
    4 x Shadow Font
    2 x Sacrificial Lamb
    3 x Bad Santa
    3 x LLN
    4 x Dimension Ripper

    General Gameplay:

|    1. First goal is to establish board control with Zal's ability,bruts,gargs, DMs and fonts if needed. Your opponent will typically have significantly more cards than you at this point. You don't have board wipes, so don't let them accumulate allies or you're screwed. Your additional font fuelled abilities should be more than sufficient to handle the early-game allies.
|
|    2. Use bad santa and wulven trackers to regain card advantage. Additional options - sacrifice any disabled or near-dead allies, and use DR for extra draw. But if your opponent has completely lost board control and has no draw engines on the board, hold the DRs and santas.
|
|    3. Molten destroyers are your late game finishers, once you have one out with a DR in play, go straight for the opponent's hero. Zal's ability and MC should be more than sufficient to handle any allies they cast out.
|
|    4. LLNs and shrieks are to deal with key strategic cards of your opponents, if possible, reserve a LLN in case your opponent grabs one of your DRs.

    Enemy specific tips:

    VS Mages - Never sac DR or SF unless absolutely necessary. These 1 should be used on their heroes as often as possible. Your cards in general are easy to handle or ignore, their's usually aren't.

    VS weapon-based heroes - Use DR only if you have or can gain board control, it usually backfires if they have board control and you whip one out. Surprisingly this deck draws almost as fast as a warrior with blood frenzy, so card advantage will be almost level in these match ups.

    VS rogues - The toughest match up in my experience. Shriek IGG, but you have to decide whether to destroy anklebreakers or spellbreaker bands, either of these items really slows your game down so it's your call.

    That's about it, hope you enjoy the deck and please do give your feedback if you see ways to tweak it better for it's intended playstyle. 

			1.1.1.8 ✰Zaladar✰ ~300 rating

    This deck made me climb to 300 rating and allowed me to stay there in 1.28 :

    Zaladar

    4 Brutalis
    4 Gargoyle
    3 Bad Wolf
    3 Death Mage
    3 Plasma Behemot
    4 Mind Control
    4 Shadow Font
    2 Soul Reaper
    1 Eternal Renewal
    2 Life Infusion
    3 Shriek
    3 Bad Santa
    4 Bazaar
    2 Armor of Ages

    43 cards

    You will need 6,000 gold to buy all the uncommon/rare/epic cards so you can build it with 5 elemental starter pack.

    ✪ Brutalis, best 2cc, he always survive one turn, help you against human and all their 1cc allies, also good to kill a 4hp ally with Zaladar ability, give you 2hp with soul reaper when he is dead (super nova), key card vs Eladwen

    ✪ Gargoyles and Bad Wolf can survive to evil ascendant, which make them better allies than Medusil/Chimera/... Also a good choice to have a Life Infusion.

    ✪ Death Mage, one of the more usefull cards, it would be x4 if he wasn't unique. Kill Dark Flayer, Kris, help brutalis to kill a 2hp ally, and have a good synergy with Zaladar ability.

    ✪ Plasma Behemot... Is always good, . Wait T7 to cast an epic Plasma Behemot with Life Infusion, only against Shadow Mage ans Shadow Hunter, the others class will simply retreat him, Mind control or captured prey him

    ✪ Mind Control, good removal card for biggies.

    ✪ Shadow Font, useful for T4 when you start first, so you can use your ability. Also useful vs Eladwen who will never let you have enough ally to kill her, use this DD.

    ✪ Soul Reaper, key card vs Eladwen, don't be afraid to cast your 3cc allies and as many brutalis as you can, a super nova will hit her for 5 and with 3 allies on the board this will allow you to heal for 6 + previous killed allies. Also very useful vs Darclaw, heal yourself and clear your graveyard for having back your shriek/Armor of Ages quickly, need a good timing for Soul Reaping and Eternal Renewing to keep some allies in your graveyard to re summon them latter, don't use it and be without allies for the last turns !!

    ✪ Eternal Renewal mostly for Darkclaw, auto sac vs Eladwen, Amber, Gravebone, ect..

    ✪ Life Infusion, use it with caution, vs Humans, Wulvens and Elementals it can be good only to "heal" a dying ally. For Plasma Behemot only vs Shadow Mage and Shadow Hunter (and Shadow Warrior).

    ✪ Shriek, against Darkclaw, Shriek only WBT. Shriek portals, Warth of the Forest, Jeweler's Dream..

    ✪ Bad Santa... For card draw ?.. Learn how to use it, Santa Bomb or in the need of a Mind Control T7...

    ✪ Bazaar, when you go first against a Warrior cast it T2 if you can, even against Ter Adun, the time for him to be able to destroy it you'll have take a good advantage. Auto sac vs Eladwen. Try to wait T5 to cast it with a 3cc ally, maybe your opponent will cast his Bazaar before T5.. If you go second it's always better to summon Brutalis if you have one in hand.

    ✪ Armor of Ages, useful vs Darkclaw and Gwen. Can be useful against the other heroes, but auto sac vs Warrior.

Ironhide Karash: With the release of DP, Karash has been the standard replacement for Brutalis, the (2) workhorse from the CotC set. I initally wanted to keep Brutalis as the utility ally for early board assistance, due to its resistance to allies and abilities that target it/kill it. Lightning Strike, ZalBlast, most (3) allies' attacks - all of these kill Karash, but all leave Brutalis intact, at least, by themselves. However, I'm not that concerned with the early board state, and in the later game, I wanted something that could be attacking for 2 points of damage, rather than only 1. Also, Karash is pretty utilitarian against most weapons, which will need to be boosted in order to kill it. So, after going back and forth, Karash was the choice for the new version's (2) ally. However, depending on the matchup, and what you expect your opponent to drop, it's not necessarily the best T2 drop you can manage, perhaps being behind Bazaar in importance, also depending on what you have in hand. This isn't a Banebow deck, and so Karash isn't always the best T2 play.


Infernal Gargoyle: for the same reasons that it is a staple ally in pretty much every Shadow deck, it is in this one also. Reasonable cost for an ally that is tough to kill, and good in the early, mid, and late phases of the game. Another reason why Gargoyle serves ZTC well is that since it almost always requires more than one source of damage to remove it from the board, it prevents those two damage sources from being targetted at your hero, and thus allowing you to live that much longer to set up your big late-game plays.


Death Mage Thaddeus: Ping damage is a great compliment to ZalBlast for killing off many allies, as well as DMT's ability to bypass the protection of stealth and armor.


Darkwood Wraith: After playing many games with the standard blend of utility allies, I found that later in the game, Mind Control was not plentiful enough, nor resource-efficient enough to be the sole source of direct ally control. Adding in Darkwood Wraith allowed me to keep my ally pool size the same (12 allies in the deck) as well as adding a versatility element to that pool. As ZTC can often lose the early board, I found that a T5 Wraith could be quite invaluable.

Hypothetical illustration: Opponent opens with traditional Puwen, Jasmine, Aldon on turns 2-4; conversely, ZTC responds with T3 DMT and pings Jasmine down to 3 health. Now, when the opponent plays Aldon on T4, Jasmine will kill DMT with her attack. On your T4, you play Shadow Font, go to 7SE, and use your ZalBlast to kill both Jasmine and Puwen. On your subsequent T5, you can play Darkwood Wraith to return Aldon back to their hand. Now, even assuming they played another ally on their T5, you have a 2/5 threat on the board that they need to address, along with 4SE in tow. On their T6, they will likely need to use both their hero ability alongside an ability or an ally's attack to get rid of your Wraith. Now you open your T6 with enough SE to ZalBlast, plus enough resources to play up to two more allies, a Mind Control, or even a Shadowvein.


Mind Control: Does this really need an explanation?


Shadow Font / Interference: Shadow Font is good for the same reasons it's always been good in Zaladar: it's tantamount to Lightning Strike. Interference is also a very powerful card, as it can not only boost your Shadow Energy levels to even greater than Shadow Font, but it also shuts down your opponent's hero ability for the next turn, which can completely (and surprisingly) ruin his plans and swing the board to your favor. However, despite the fact that Interference can be far more powerful than Shadow Font, there are also many times/matchups where your opponent doesn't keep much SE stored, and so Shadow Font is far more useful to you. That is why there is a 2/2 split between the two of them.

On a side note, used alongside Shadowvein, Interference can be incredibly powerful. Let's say your opponent is Eladwen, and you have no allies on the board, compared to his Raven, Aldon, and Kristoffer Wyld - conversely, your board is empty. You have 4SE stored, and Eladwen has 3SE. You use your ability, dealing 3 damage to both Raven and Aldon - you are @ 0SE. You play Shadowvein, and attack Aldon to kill him. You go to 1 SE, Eladwen goes to 4SE. Now it's your opponent's turn. Eladwen goes to 5SE, and attacks you with Krist (killing him) and Raven, leaving her at 1 health. You go up to 3SE, and Eladwen is now at 7SE, and still has no targets upon which to use her ability. Now it's your turn, and Zaladar goes up to 4SE. You use ZalBlast to kill off Raven and deal 3 damage to Eladwen, leaving you @ 0SE. Now you play Interference, sending you soaring to 7SE, and with your remaining 3-4 resources, you play an ally such as a Gargoyle or DMT, and your opponent cannot use Eladwen's ability on their following turn. You also still have 1 durability left on your Shadowvein This could go on and on, but you see how poweful this combo can be.


Feedback: Seriously?


Ley Line Nexus: Primary purpose for inclusions are The King's Pride, powerful weapons, such as Soul Seeker (especially with Gwen, who is one of the tougher matchups for this deck) and Snow Sapphire, which can slow your progress , as it can anyone's. Note, Dimension Ripper is to be feared, as it can steal your Feedbacks, which can spell disaster for you later on when turned against you.


Soul Reaper: The deck, with only 12 allies, seems ill-suited for Soul Reaper. The truth of the matter is that this deck can often come dangerously close to death, all the while only being 1-2 turns away from winning it all. Being down to 7 life against a Mage, for example, is very dangerous, regardless of how many resources you have, as they can throw a Lightning Strike and Fireball at you and end the game. By the time this has come to pass, you've likely gotten at least 3 allies in your graveyard, and so a Soul Reaper at this point gains you 6 life, putting you above that dreaded "blindside kill" threat range. Two are included because nothing is more annoying than only having on Soul Reaper in your deck and drawing it in your open hand. 


Bad Santa: Fodder for Feedbombs, or at the very least, Santa Bombs early, midway, or late in the game. On T1, if you've got a Bazaar in your opening hand, it's definitely alright to sacrifice one, or even two, Bad Santas. You only need 1-2 later on throughout the game to get off a poweful Feedbomb, alongside Bazaar.


Bazaar: The heart of the deck. It's that simple. You CAN win without it, of course, but your battle will be much harder. I wouldn't advise ever sacrificing even an extra one, until you've really gotten your board in place (T5+ with cards in hand) because if your opponent gets off an early Shriek of Vengeance, or Artful Squire against you, it's very hard to keep pace with them, as they'll likely have drawing power, and you will not.


Word of the Prophet: Almost exclusively to help your T1 hand. It's very, very strong to have a T2 Bazaar, especially if going first, so having a Word of the Prophet in hand is akin to having 5x Bazaars in your deck, in terms of your odds to play a T2 Bazaar. It also can empty your hand of expensive items on T1, so you can Santa Bomb on T2, as well as having replaced the cards from your hand that you wouldn't be able to play early on in the game, anyway (Feedback, Shadowvein, et al). If you get one in your opening hand, but it doesn't help your T2-3 situation, it's best to just use it as your T1 sac.

but the main goal is the constant "lightning strikes" 

i dont think i need more explanation than that.

The key to play this deck is to keep playing your tough allies regardless of your board position. With unilateral draw engine and Zal's zapping power, you will eventually be able to take the board. This deck wins with 2 cards: Soul Reaper and Shadowvein.

Soul Reaper
This is the reason why you can afford to spend 3cc every turn on Antimatter. SR's massive health gain gives you a lot of time to have a better hand and gradually taking the control of the board.

Shadowvein
An absolute finisher of this game. It alone produces 8 plus 3x2 damage if not destroyed. This card is also great in a defensive use as it softens opponent allies when your hero defends, and Zaladar can use the charged SE to burn damaged allies. Also, thanks to Soul Reaper, you can still play allies even if Shadowvein helps opponents to kill your allies with SE ability.

In this deck, playing 1 ally means that you are getting rid of more than 7 damage from your hero in average. For example, playing MA means that you are diverting 5 damage to MA from your hero, and getting 2 extra heal with Soul Reaper. In other words, Soul Reaper is a massive advantage gaining card. Antimatter also helps getting rid of unnecessary allies in the deck while producing 2 points heal form SR.

Q. Why is there only 3 Mind Control and 3 Shadow Font? 

Mind control in this deck is merely an ally removal. In D-ripper Zal, you want 4 MCs because it very useful in life racing (killing 1 ally and dealing 2~5 damage for a single 5cc card is very cost efficient), but you don't really race with this deck. From that viewpoint, MC is too expensive to cast and you don't need 4 of single ally removal along with Zal's zapping power. Given that it is not a card that I have to have on t5, inclusion of only 3 is sufficient.

The idea of including only 3 Shadow Font came from Greymouser's Antimatter Zal (see the link at the beginning of this section). Adding to his original explanation, the reason why you don't need 4 is because your optimal t4 play is often not shadow font. For example, when you are going second against a human hero, your best t4 play is DMT to kill opponent allies with Zal blast. T4 2nd 3cc ally buys you time to cast and use Antimatter on t5 as well as giving you a chance to t5 Sac Lamb the damaged 3cc ally and make your mid game easier. With t5 FT covering the early game failure, you don't have to use SF in the early game. 

By cutting out 1 Shadow font and 1 Mind control, this deck becomes more lean and compressed. The probability of drawing Antimatter goes up, while it also raises the chance to have crucial item destructions in time. But if you think that there are many games where you must cast 4 MCs and 4 SFs to win, feel free to add them back in.

4 MC and 4 SF  The cards are selected so that it is not so hard to deal with when they are stolen. For example, MA is a lot more easier to deal with for Zal than Garg, and so is FT. Some D-Ripper deck uses Gargs and Darkwood Wraith, but Gargs are sometimes too resilient when and DW is annoying if stolen, even though it synergizes with Bad Santa and D-Ripper.

T5 is more stable than before as FT are in as 5th~7th copy of D-Ripper which provides 2 point damage when played. Shadowvein is again a game finisher in this deck.

There is no SoV because it is not needed to destroy opponent's draw engines as both you mainly draw with Bad Santa and D-Ripper. 

t2 Karash/Santa if going first

Well, there is not much to say really. D-Ripper Zal was very popular in CotC and it is almost the same with DP set.




				1.1.1.12.3 Mill Zaladar 

As far as I know, fist solid mill Zaladar deck was posted by Flynn here:
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread....CotC-Mill-Deck 

The deck below is heavily influenced by his Zaladar.

2x Ogloth the Gluttonicon
4x Furrion Terror
2x Kairos Doombringer

***Abilities (18)***

4x Bazaaricon
3x Infinity Core

***Armors (4)***
4x Armor of Agesicon

TOTAL: 43 cards + Hero

Type: Control
Resource: 10~12
Speed: Slow

As it is said in Flynn's thread the key to win with this deck is to play something every turn no matter what. Use 4x Word of the Prophet to reach better cards. AoA buys so much time, while SE ability, EA and Furrion Terror kill opponent's weenies. Conversion is there to gain extra healing along with Infinity Core, and it is the only way to capitalize your allies with CB/CP/CF or negative effects. Never sac Eternal Renewal, but 1 copy is enough since you can put it back into the deck with WotP and you only use it once in a game.

The reason why I introduce this archetype along with Antimatter and D-Ripper Zal is because people I know have used this deck and had a very good result in both popups and QM. The fact that this deck requires you to have certain cards/strategy to counter makes this Zaladar very competitive as long as it stays outside of the meta.

Basically, this zaladar has so many items that opponents need to destroy. A standard shadow deck with 2 SoV cannot simply deal with 4 EA, 4 Bazaar and 3 Infinity Core. Unless your deck has a way to deal damage over Armor of Ages, you cannot finish the game before this zaladar start dropping 2 fatties in a turn.

I excluded from the list, but Interference might be a good addition since you play almost no allies until t5 or 6 but you will have to use your SE ability to delay your opponent. Though, I am not sure if it will still be useful in the late game.





So these are the 3 competitive Zaladars I know. I'm sure there are more competitive ones though (maybe HBM zaladar, or other creative ones).

			1.2.1.1  "Infernal Winter" (Gravebone 1.5)
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?16888-quot-Infernal-Winter-quot-%28Gravebone-1-5%29

    Lately, I've been seeing a lot of sentiment on the forums that Gravebone is not very good. A number of people seem intent on "making him work," so to speak. I find this odd, because Gravebone has actually been one of the stronger heroes in the game going all the way back to the test server release (during this time, in fact, people were worried that nothing could ever beat him...ah, how times change). So to combat the perception that Gravebone is not totally awesome, I am releasing a pair of awesome Gravebone decks for your viewing pleasure.

    Here we have the control-oriented build, which is one of my favorite decks that I have. I used it a few times in the World Championships swiss rounds, and I believe it only ever lost one game there.

    1x Gravebone

    4x Brutalis
    4x Gargoyle
    3x Death Mage Thaddeus
    3x Plasma Behemoth
    3x Molten Destroyer

    2x Clinging Web
    4x Fireball
    4x Lightning Strike
    3x Supernova

    3x Research
    3x Sacrificial Lamb
    3x Shriek

    3x Voice of Winter

    [43 cards]

    The deck might take a little practice if you're not used to playing Gravebone. You have the tools to maintain a strong early position, and your opponent will have to expend a significant amount of his resources to deal with the early game. Moving into the mid-game, you'll be dropping fatties and using burn to dominate board position. Once you're ahead on the board and have a little SE saved up, drop Voice of Winter for the total lock. Your opponent's allies will be frozen for 2 turns, giving you plenty of time to kill them at your leisure, and if something happens to your guys, GB's ability can revive them without getting them frozen. The VoW lock also shuts down Portal, Lance (who will often use his STs on Research by mistake), and pretty much any ally-dependent deck. Even if they pack some LLN to dispose of your VoW, that gives you an entire turn where they basically did nothing and you get to entrench your board position and hit for major damage.

    For the times you may have lost board control, a key play is to drop VoW -> Supernova + GB ability. There are very few boards you cannot dominate after that play. Be careful with VoW, however! It is not for T5 or T6 in most cases. Early VoWs can be sac'd off (that's why the deck has 3 of them).

    A tweak you could make if you were so inclined would be -3 MD for +3 SK. It gives you a bit of extra sustainability on your draw and so forth, and is a good config. I personally still prefer the MDs for their extra survivability and ping damage (plus Raven has to doom herself in order to disable them), but it's more a personal preference thing.

    TL;DR stuff all in green

    This guide holds my dearest, favourite, secret tricks that I've been using with GB. Granted, I may not be the first, but you can be sure that I found them out on my own. I shall be posting two versions of GB that I have, Monster Control being the first, far more entertaining one, and Brutal Is Control, the serious competitive one.

    Total Card count=42 Including hero

    This deck is fun. It is the most fun that I've ever had in SE. After playing stressful matches of Zhannaicon control and Eladwenicon rush from 1.29, it's the most fun deck I've ever played. This deck is slow, but strong and well controlled. The tempo it has is quite effecient, and uses simple uni-lateral Draw to out pace opponents. As it isn't a fast deck, your best trick is to push out meat shields, thus the beauty of gargoyle, PB and Oggy.

    Here's how it's played, in a nutshell.

    Turn 1-4 is not much. Your main target is to get out 1 research, 1 gargoyle and 1 Tracker/Lightning Strike.

    Turn 5 is when you try to drop a PB, who should die. When he does, Turn 6: nova and recurse. Save Webs for Human decks, especially for sandworm. Try to save DoU for everything else. Against Ravens and Oggy (anything at 6HP), you can go for the kill instead by supernova-ing first before attacking with DoU (DoU kills everything at 1 HP, including heroes lol).

    The BEST part of this monster deck, is when you get to play with Ogloth. He is a beast with GB, and in case you don't know how to use him, let me introduce the Oggy Bomb:


    Oggy Bomb
    Step 1: Get Ogloth into play.
    Step 2: Supernovaicon, instantly bringing ogloth to an obscene attack (as all 4cc and below allies cannot survive SuperNova), which you can use to ability+attack.

    The beauty about GB, is that Ogloth can be recursed to play even after death, thus the Oggy Bomb can be pulled of very, very easily. Many people have been saying that Ogloth is easily countered by Crippling Blowicon and Capture Prey... But this deck vs anyone who uses these cards, is almost always auto-win.

    Unleashing the Monster
    Often after an opponent locks an Oggy down, they ignore him and go for other allies (which they should, because you're still dropping other Monsters that must be answered.When opportune, using 7 resources, unleash the Monster with Sever Ties, use his ability, and attack. This move often turns the entire game in your favour.

    This trick is much meaner with Ogloth. As long as Oggy is at 6HP and above, he will not only survive a Supernova, but grow larger each time. This threat tends to go unnoticed till it's too late, and I have used this trick to unlock large, monster sized Ogloths, often 10-20 damage Ogloth.

    Saving Nasty Surprises
    Every deck has a weakness. Hunters and mages often rely on 5cc weapons/armours, so you save LLN for them.

    Save shriek for draw engines, but do not use it before turn 7, as you often are not able to afford it.

    Sever Ties is my favourite of them all. Not just to unleash the Monster, but because it hard counters many decks. Gwen at turn 5 must try to get Rapid Fireicon out, and if you have a sever ties in your starting hand, wait for it. The beauty of it is that the low count of sever ties often means that it appears at extreme late game (which this deck is perfectly capable at handling itself), do when it does appear, the opponent almost 80% has resourced every other copy of his favourite attachment.

    Thus, when you finally use it, you could be dropping the final nail in the tombstone. In particular, Warrior decks bite the dust due to this card. Not only does crippling blow become a big lapse, a sever ties can literally remove +10 HP from a warrior, which means instant death the moment he is below 10 HP (even if he kept another copy in hand, its too late).

    This deck rocks.

    Thank you for your time, and I hope all of you enjoy this deck as much as I did.

    P.S. To play this deck well, you should read my other guide to get an idea on how to play it.

What some people might not know is that when Nishaven left the first portal open it's energy could not sustain the mass of the massive fat shadow spawn waiting to pour into the realm. Gravebone was tasked with amassing the hoarde of shadow allies by taking pairs through to the other side.

This was the deck.

Current Deck (40):

2 x Plasma Behemoth
2 x Molten Destroyer
2 x Brutal Minator

Having great success with this deck as it seems to have so many tools through the abilities of the allies combined with the support cards through the early turns. The new high HP shadow allies really come into their own with Gravebone's ability

2cc - 16
3cc - 15
4cc - 4
5cc - 5

General Play Style:

The general idea is that you are going to spam you SBO's to create a ping cycle. This normally doesn't work too well because your also giving your opponent SE. The counter to this is Sanctuary. This card is my favorite at the moment. You can chain these together negating opponents hero ability use (which is useful against all heroes, except Jerry). The beauty is that you can use your ability in between, so basically you bring the ping SBO monster back from the graveyard but opponent can't counter with SE assistance. SK is extra meat but also to bring back the ping twin or gargoyle depending on matchup. Deck uses a lot of 3cc allis and relies heavily on drawing on Tok to dig for the sanctuaries so you can chain them, this (and SBO) is reason for limited 5cc allies in deck. SK in opening hand is usually a sac card.

A part of Gravebones biggest strength is his ability to revive a fatty into play, this is also a big weakness as most seasoned players have learned ways to deal with the predictable play patterns of Gravebone. Lots of heroes rely on their hero ability to help put the fatty back into the ground and generally it works. During matches you will not be able to stop your opposing hero from using their ability, but what you are trying to do is prevent it's use at a critical time to help turn the tide in your favor. Timing is more difficult with opponents with cost of 3SE so they shoot off 1-2 uses before you can start stalling them, and sometimes depending on hand/board/situation it's better to force opponent to use ability early and set them up for the next cycle. 

Lightning strike is most important ability on any matchup you think an opponent is using FT. 

Alt version using Plasma Behemoths in lieu of SK. Gives more meat to the build, however turns away from the drawing force needed to fuel the engine to dig for sanctuaries.

Some of the Medium to Good Matchups:

Amber. An Amber without a buffed JD is pretty weak. What's really nice is even though ambers ability only cost 3se she can't /doesn't typically use her ability until turn 4 with JD. If you are able to setup sanctuary early you can put a really big dent into her game plan and you'll notice she plays her turns more slowly, having to create an alternative game plan for the matchup. Even if you don't get sanctuaries you should still be able to play SBOs freely (though they die to buffed weapons) because extra SE really is no use to Amber as she has to go through her weapons to buff another one, so this SBO benefits you more in this one. 

Gwen (solo). A Gwen without a buffed weapon is pretty weak and rapid fire just turns her into CotC Baduru. Now that being said her saving grace is ITF. She can use these to stall out sanctuaries, and if she is using night prowler she can flip the switch on you. This matchup is still favored towards you. SBO ping and nova bypass ITF (finishing moves). Sac lamb is a good card to prevent any healing from soul seeker and dig more sanctuaries.

Eladwen. Sanctuary turns Eladwen into Gravebone....what this means is since she cannot use her ability to help control the board, she has to start directing her burn toward your allies. The more burn she uses this way the higher probability you will win. If you go second, you will want to play Ironhide, gargoyle, tok + sanctuary, draw + SBO, draw +, etc..... The early hard to kills will set you up nicely, and on 4 block her ice stall advantage. Even if she wipes on 5 you claim the board because it will be empty on your turn.

Lance. Without his hasted raven, he's just not as strong. Stop thief! Can't destroy Sanctuary, Ironhide beats down anklebreakers, CF for raven or aeons. I haven't run into any Spelleater bands but board seems to be easier to regain/control so I'm sure it will be as much a problem.

Logan. Logan lost a lot of his strength when his ability was changed to 4SE. While DP has brought him some new toys his ability remains his strength and the board is dependent on his having access to this + weapons. Combined with Killing Spree essentially he could have great control, but by shutting this down with Sanctuary he will have a hard time regaining board after his early setup.

Baduruu. Sanctuary works really well against Baduruu. Normally his ability is used as a tempo boost he needs to help control the early and late game. By using sanctuary we are removing not only the tempo but also the weapon boost maximizing the effectiveness of IK and Gargoyles to beat down the weapon durability of the unbuffed weapons. Res D isn't really a problem for this deck because all the allies are super cheap, as well as drawing, sanctuary and CF. Snare trap is a motha, so you kinda have to be caution on what you play when you think it's out. Ironhide/DMT are usually my trap disarmer if possible. I've yet to be afraid to play SBO for fear of giving Baduruu more SE. LS are still going to be key spells because of FT, but nova will be equally important for disrupting board as well as denying potential healing from SS. 

Gravebone. If your opponents name is buqs.....just rage quit early and deny him any winnings. On a serious note, taking away GBs hero ability can ruin him for the whole game. He is typically a hero that doesn't use his ability until turn 5-7 for the first time, so a lot of times you can wait to lock his ability out with Sanctuary. Additionally without any access to healing the ping will really start to wear down on him. While playing, remember to keep some combo damage options available. Opponent will more than likely be playing with some fatties/hard to kill allies and most of ours dont deal much damage on their own.

Darkclaw. Sanctuary totally wrecks a the strength of a solo Darkclaw build. Without the weapon buff and ambush Darkclaw will really take a beating. Combine this with tech items like severed ties for lone wolf and this should be a fairly favorable matchup.

Moonstalker. As a Mage this is already a favorable matchup, if your using the PB build then it is even more favorable. SBO is a bit counter productive because it increases the hiding potential of moon, but if you have board and are able to lock out the stall with sanctuaries you can just drop the hammer hard. If it's an allied moon, then matchup becomes unfavorable.

Zaladar. This one can be difficult depending on skill level of your opponent. This is not necessarily the perfect build against Zaladar but it stands a very good chance against him. Zaladar relies on his ability more than most heroes and actually runs a full set of shadow font and possibly other things that help him accumulate SE. Sanctuary is a very effective card against Zaladar because it really minimizes the effectiveness of those cards. SBO is actually not a good ally to revive in this matchup because he comes back with the 5 attack which is just begging for a mind control. I would only revive him if I'm planning on using a sac lamb on him for ping + draw. Usually I use SBOs to accelerate gargoyle revivals, but I try to stagger them in play, so they take reduced damage at different rates, hence dying at different turns and revival at different turns. This is guaranteed to have FT in this matchup, so save them LS.....you will need them.

General Play Style:

A portal build is by far my favorite way to play the game so it will always have a home for one of my Gravebone deck slots. Since DPs release it has been the least played of my 3 decks so it it not as developed as the other 2 decks are and still likely to evolve. 

The early game for Gravebone never really changes. We always want to try and get some allies down early or at least use our DD and/or CF to minimize the damage of opponents early game. Gravebone really needs to save as much HP as possible to help him transition to the mid-late game where he can become more dangerous, so if you have to use ability early (turn 4/5) its worth it. Doesnt really matter saving for turn 6-7 if your dead. Unlike the other 2 build this one use more aggressive allies (cc = to attack power) to maximize effectiveness through portal. SK is also included because he helps to draw (pseudo) allies needed to fuel portals duration. alot of times you want to retrieve either low cost allies or SKs, while saving Gbs ability for MDs, Kairos or what ever other ally is needed at the moment. This Gravebone has the ability to recreate a broken SK loop more easily than any other GB or other hero build because of the combination of Hero ability, SK and DC. {Examples, GB ability [on SK] + Sac Lamb + SK; GB ability and/or Death Collector ability on top allies to get to a buried SK, then play SK from hand.} The portal build is also a fragile build (allies are typically easy to kill) so we include some more durable allies in the form of MD and Kairos. Both provide a different form of retaliation which can be useful to survive the day. Ive reduced ToKs from 3 to 2 swapping 1 for BS. Sometimes you really just need that quick draw to help reload to maximize portals effectiveness and Tok can be to slow. 

I personally dont like to play with Item D other than shriek (which usually I use 2 except for sanctuary build which uses none). So what Ive done for this build is mixed things up a bit. Portal + allies make sense on multiple levels, so Ive brought in RW and Colossus for their respective abilities. All are different in what they do, but also more importantly in their cost (SoV 1, RW 3 and SC 6). RW is the new comer to my recent change in the deck (replacing 1BW, 1SoV and adding 1CF) TBD if hes staying.

CF is a great card to play with portal. It is cheap enough control card to play with other allies and also (more often than not) affords the oppotunity for your allies to go for the hero and ignore opponents allies. I was looking for a way to up the count to 3 (see changes in above paragraph).

The introduction of FT kinda requires that all mages use LS. In lieu of 4 though I only use 3 because with portal I have the opportunity to use allies to deal with FTs. Nova + GB is still a good move, and even better when you use portal send all allies for throat (opponents spend time removing your threats) and then when portal duration ends, nova (more damage) + revive (board).

Some of the Medium to Good Matchups:

Boris (allied). Boris is generally played with a fast paced tempo build geared towards mid late game swarm / dominance. He generally has a few spots in his game plan where you can swing the game in your favor. Most notably these are the turns when he plays blood frenzy (usually turn 3/4), or when he has a weak board and only plays kings pride or enrage. He also has great tempo disrupters like cb and retreat, as well as his hero ability and dragons tooth. To combat this control machine we attempt to match his tempo both in board as well as draw. We use a portal build as we can generally get the most use of our allies before Boris can begin controlling them. We also use a lot of aggressive allies to maximize damage output from portal. Drawing will come from SKs as well as sac lambs (CBed allies). LS not favorable because it does not kill most of the allies Boris uses on its own so we lean more on portal/nova instead. 

Victor. Victor will be a fairly even matchup but should be favored towards Gravebone. IK and Md are going to be a pain for Victor to deal with so he will end up having to use poison arrows on IK and TPS/hero ability on Mds which will still provide a double ping. Additionally you got a potential SK loop which can cause Victor to run out of control answers and eventually loose the game. A portal build to reduce the effectiveness of the control aspect that Victor relies on to manipulate the game. Shriek is included to remove snare trap at key points in the game, but also useful if Victor is running WOTF. Sac Lamb and Nova are here for mainly for removing healing options from Victor but Nova can produce great control allowing some shots on hero before wiping and reviving your own ally (preferably a MD).

Nishaven. The fact that Nish has a slow charge ability really dicates how you can play this game. Nishs ability will kill all your early board allies fairly easily (low health). Typically I will play a board just before Nish has a full charge as a deterent for him to use his ability as a hasted ally (+ ally revive) can potentially negate his ability wipe + ally play, plus you have yet another turn of duration for portal. Now Nish is not a frequently played hero so the builds are not consitant yet. If it is a portal build, usually whoever plays the portal second (and can capture the board) will win the game. If Nish is playing a Vow build, your changes are greatly reduced and the matchup becomes medium to worse. VoW negates portal slows traditional play, probably has retreats and is probably playing with DoT abilities. Win-able but a long hard game.

Jericho. The long game isn't there for Jericho like his counterpart Zhanna. Your aggressive allies should be able to either cotrol the board or absorb some damage while you are building your resources for a board wipe. Jerry's late game allies are typically gong to come out one at a time and you should be able to control or possibly even ignore them and just go straight for hero. CF is not a good choice in this matchup. Jerry can remove with his ability, but he also has option of ALR. This one you may lose simply because there are not enough Jerry players out and about and people dont know what to do when they see him.

Zhanna. You want to take advantage of Zhanna early and deal as much damage as possible. Gravebone has the opportunity to flood the board after tidal wave which is increased by cards like portal. A late game KP can sometimes mean trouble but a carefully timed Colossus can keep her board pace slowed. SK looping will be the typical form of drawing, and potential damaging source if you've got a portal in play. Also try to save fireballs and LS for end game mass damage that KP can't prevent. Save your single BS and try to save the Sac Lamb, you may need them. 

Logan. Logan is going to want to try and control the board. Portal allows us to deal the damage prior to allies being controlled. Logan has the potential to own the board so, nova plays a big part in this game plan. This is typically a matchup where you'll want to portal rush and follow up with nova. The only time this could become problematic is if it is a rampage build. Your cheap allies are like pac-man pellets. Combat this by switching to burn mode and only reviving MDs (Kairos depending on opponents SE) and or getting resources high enough to deal some big unhealable damage through portal.

Banebow. This will not be easy by any stretch of the imagination, but portal affords the best opportunity for Gravebone to deal with Banebow. BB will still be able to heal from your allies, but control aspect of BBs game will come after your allies have been summoned. Snare trap will be problematic for your little guys, FT + BB ability + Bow will be problematic for your big guys (also TPS). He even has shrieks for your portals. This doesnt sound like a good matchup, but I find this is the best shot youve (or at least me) got. Hit hard and fast. If you let him get setup and start drawing alot (WOTF), hell just get all the tools needed to beat you easier.

Gravebone. While most GB builds will typically take the traditional Fatty build this portal build is a hybrid of sorts to that concept. Portal affords the opportunity to aggressively take the board in ways that nova does not. Allies though portal to take out his allies but you put a body on the board and you did not take 5 damage. We still have nova in the deck because a fatty build is still a challenge but the goal is to be able to be the last one to use hero ability. Typically this means opponent has run out of options and you will quickly end the match once the board remains yours.

Darkclaw. Like Boris, DC generally is able to use a lot of control features to allies on the board. Portal lets us allow our allies to attack first and minimizes DCs effectiveness. Lots of big allies so you should be able to punch with some force. MD is great if EA is on the board for some DoT effects reducing effectiveness of Lone Wolf. Recycle them with GB ability and SKs. Try to save abilities for massive DD damage all at once or after portal expiration. Nova/Sac Lamb good for freeing up allies disabled with CP. IK and Kairos are great during turns DC does not have buffed teeth. Colossus can absorb damage or wreak some havock on Dcs gameplan.

General Play Style:

This deck is a traditional fatty build. It has good early game with allies, abilities and CF. PB is the star of this deck. He has potential to deal with multiple targets and deal massive damage, and with the inclusion of bloodthirsty he can quickly get out of control and help you draw some cards at the same time. Oggy plays a similar role to PB. The higher health means you can still oggy bomb and bloodthirsty with ability can quickly get his attack/health levels up. Kairos is also in because I prefer not to play with ST or get caught with 2 unique high cost allies. While BT can be good with Kairos it's not really as great with other 2 allies. Kairos is good because of high health, steadfast and retaliation damage. GBs ability lends the opportunity to stall with bloodthirsty in hand and wait until you get the board to play it safely. Nova + ability pretty much guarantees this can happen often. 

Some of the Medium to Good Matchups:

Amber. We've got a large number of hard to kill allies so they will generally require 2 sources of damage to kill. CB can minimize the effectiveness of PB but they must be completely killed to be non-threatening, which means you can revive them often. Amber will typically use allies lite on HP so nova can easily reset the board, also bloodthirsty can assist in keeping pace on draw. Kairos can reduce the chances of Amber death racing if you can get to him and he doesn't get CBed.

Gwen. This match really all depends on if Gwen is playing with ITF and/or how much damage you can put down before she gets set up. Typically shes got until turn 6 before she takes off and GB has enough early game to put the pressure on. Bazaar should be shrieked immediately. Save your Sac Lamb/Novas for denying Gwen healing opportunities. Nova is also able to deal damage and bypass ITF. Kairos is great for retaliation attacking Gwen. He will take a beating too, but he helps to reduce the weapon durability much faster.

Nishaven. We are going to combat Nish with lots of hard to kill allies. most allies are going to require 5+ damage to remove which put them just out of nish blast range. Nish typically has a rush deck, or a high costing deck. The high cost version may be solo with either Vow or DoU, Vow version can become difficult if he gets set up properly. Rush version is easier as Nish can't control your allies like Eladwen can, and he also has to have a higher resource count. Drawing on ToK becomes too slow of a draw for this, so he may be playing with bad santas.

Lance. Morbid Acolyte and PB are the stars in this matchup. They are able to bypass the stealth effects of Lances ability and both generally are allies Lance want completely removed from the board. IK is another ally the performs well against lance because he is immune to anklebreakers. He also generally becomes the target of an assassination or hasted ally attack depending on the state of the game. Shriek is for IGG and CF can really assist in numbing the effects of ravens (as can MA). This is a much more winable matchup than a CotC Lance.

Serena. This can be a good matchup for you. Weve got 6 good fatties but really PB is best followed by Kairos. PB again will be the superstar. A buffed weapon is not strong enough to take out PB on its own so Serena will be forced to disable with anklebreakers or combo up to take him out until he is removed from board. Kairos is decent, as Serena may decide to go for the hero, force discard, then deal with combat to Kairos as a 4/4 HP swap. Black Garb can be problematic, so you will may want to use a shriek on this at a key point in the game. But do remember she is probably holding onto another one so make sure the damage is large enough to justify its use (since you would not be using on IGG). If you can get ahead on the board with a few allies you can really make Serena suffer but she does have the tools to potentially own you. Skill of Serena player is heavily a determining factor in this one.

Ter Adun. PB is king in this matchup. Your not going to have a reliable draw engine so slow playing will kinda be forced on you. PBs ability is unaffected by attack modifiers (CB, Punishers Gauntlets, etc) so you will typically have a consistant source of damage and the 5 health usually mean 1-2 turns of surviveability.

Gravebone. OK so this deck has the tools to deal with a Gravebone. Some key allies will be Oggy and Kairos because of their nova surviveability. PB is still good too. This matchup will typically go to howmever can get setup properly first.

Darkclaw. A solo darkclaw should not present a ton of problems. If you can get your allies down early and put the beating on him. IK and Gargs are not affected by an unbuffed WBT so swing away. They will become the targets for NYRM. Captured prey can be troublesome because it shuts down PB completely (as well as DCs hero buff w/ speedstrike), but we've got enough of them to get a rotation going to get the big damage in. You've also got shriek which you can use a critical points for WBT or EA, basically when certain allies are about to die.

Moonstalker. As a Mage this is already a favorable matchup and cycling PB just isn't even fair.
MA is primary board choice over Gargoyle for any allies that may be included in opponents deck (I usually try to keep 1 MA on board at all times. Once PB is in graveyard he becomes primary revive and MAs should be played from hand as support. Shriek for stall tactics if board is set up for big damage, or for EA to reduce DoTs on your allies. 

Elementalis. This is probably the best shot GB has at good matchups vs Elementalis, which is only better if opponent has a bad opening. The really hard to kill allies that Elementalis produces usually means you are fighting from behind and having to use DD to help chop down the HP of those allies so that you can kill them off with some form of combo technique. If you can drop PB on empty board and have him stick for a turn or 2 while you build momentum you can get the win. CF becomes a big assistance in this matchup, but be careful about leaving opposing allies alive because of Superfocus. If Elementalis build is Sanctuary/Interference build you are probably in for some trouble.

Zaladar. This matchup has tons of things that Zal hates. Lots of hard to kills Gargoyles and MA, and PB has low attack so retaliation from MC is low. Zal still has a shot at winning but he's going to sweat and it should be a close match.

---------

Majiya is probably the worst matchup for these 3 decks.

				1.2.1.7.1 [291 R] shadowphnx's Gravebone and Trolls Deck
I am very excited to share with all of you my really fun to play 336 rated (9/25/16) Graveboneicon deck. 

| Why should you play this deck? 
| 1. If you like reviving Eternal Trolls and Phoenix Urigons to the dismay of your opponent
| 2. If you like to play Supernovaicon where only your opponent's allies get wiped
| 3. And if you are very cold, you like to use the Voice of Wintericon so that only your opponent's allies stay frozen

then this is the deck for you!

Hero: Graveboneicon
Allies: (19)
4x Feasterling
2x Ironhide Karashicon
4x Eternal Troll
3x Infernal Gargoyleicon
4x Phoenix Urigonicon
2x Dakrathicon

Abilities: (19)
4x Sacrificial Lambicon
4x Bad Santaicon
3x Relentless Savagery
4x Fireballicon
4x Supernovaicon

Weapons: (3)
3x Voice of Wintericon

Deck Explanation:
There are a number of ways to secure victory in the deck, but the main goal is board control.
Here are some combos to look out for:

Feasterling + Relentless Savagery = 5 attack, enough to kill many 3 and 4 turn allies.

Eternal Troll + Eternal Troll + Relentless Savagery = As you crash your Eternal Troll into your opponent's allies, Relentless Savagery will return to your hand when the Troll dies and you can play it again. I have killed opposing Dakraths this way.

Supernova + Eternal Troll or Phoenix Urigonicon = Wipe the board with your allies still in play!

Voice of Winter + Sacrificial Lambicon + Eternal Troll or Phoenix Urigon = Get rid of the frozen status of your allies while drawing 3 cards. (As Buqs pointed out, for the Eternal Troll, you should wait until the turn after you summoned it to use Sacrificial Lamb so that it doesn't die.).

Voice of Winter + Supernova + Eternal Troll or Phoenix Urigon = An alternative method for getting rid of the frozen status of your allies.

Voice of Winter + Dakrathicon = Dakrath can't be frozen and is very hard to kill. Also a worthy candidate for revival.

Gravebone + Voice of Winter = Allies that Gravebone returns to play won't be frozen by Voice of Winter!

Sacrificial Lamb + Gravebone = Kill your possibly incapacitated ally and then revive it!

General Tips

Voice of Winter is a weapon, you can and often should attack with it. Don't forget this! Especially if your opponent is playing item destruction.
This can easily amount to 2 or 3 damage to the opponent as there is a good chance your opponent will not have
the item destruction in their hand when you play it. However also be careful that you don't cause your Voice of Winter to die either.

Bad Santaicon is a really great card if you anticipate your opponent having a really strong draw engine. Otherwise be careful about playing it.

3 Plasma Behemot
4 Fireball
4 Lightning Strike
3 Super Nova
4 Tome of Knowledge
3 Ley Line Nexus
2 Shriek
2 Sever Ties
3 Dagger of Unmaking

❆ Firesnake: very good T1 when going second, kill Kris, give space in your hand if your opponent want to Santa Bomb, think twice before summoning it vs Shadow, Carniboars enjoy eating them. Also useful in late game, if you draw it and have far enought ressources to summon it, it gave lots of advantage like destroying armor, weapons, distracting opponent from targeting your hero sometimes, ans give the +1 attack which can give you the victory in close game.

❆ Gargoyle: best T3 drop so far, try to not summon two of them if you see Banebow letting his shadow energy growing to 5

❆ Death Mage: one of my favourite ally, summoning him T3 is a bad idea, but if you have nothing better to do...synergize well with Majiya's ability, also good to kill a T3 Priest of the Light when you have a gargoyle on the board. Nice meat shield too since he can do his 1 damage when summoning

❆ Plasma Behemot: wins game, haha, one PB on the board trigger Tidal Wave , against wulven if they don't have Captured Prey in hand it's near gg for you, only way to deal with it for warriors is Retreat, cause crippling blow is just a joke on PB, auto sac vs Elementals, or at least summon if you have already a Dagger of Unmaking out, against Mage try to keep one to summon it right after a Super Nova, but it's better to sac it in most games, better make your ressources grow to burn the opponent before he burns you down.

❆ Fireball: never cast it T3 on the hero, it's dumb, or use an other deck focused on rush. It's better to skip the turn than wasting a Fireball which can help you the next turn to keep the board in control. T4 Fireball + attack with gargoyle to kill an opponent's Gargoyle is good.

❆ Lightning Strike: well.. 6 damages for 4cc.. What to say more? Obvious move, Majiya's ability + LS to kill a Gargoyle

❆ Super Nova: auto sac one in early game if going first, you'll have what you need to keep board in check without using it before T6~7, good game finisher, save ass by making draw when you're going to lose. Majiya's ability + Super Nova kill everything (except Sandworms, but with only one hp left, he's a good as dead)

❆ Tome of Knowledge: usually cast T2, if your opponent Shriek it he will lose one ressources, that good enought to let him destroying it, , Human Wariors, Mage and Hunter can't destroy it, only Rogue and Priest can, so wait T4 to cast + use ability or even later.

❆ Ley Line Nexus: never sac against Hunter and Rogue, against others heroes i always sac my first to keep allies and spells in hand.

❆ Shriek: only 2 of them, cause i don't like losing ressources early, and never shriek a Tome of Knowledge, WotF or other stuff except Witzen Staff or a Portal or Ill Goten Gain. If opponent cast Bazaar, smile and enjoy the free burn. After reaching 5~6 ressources shriek what you feel like disturbing.

❆ Sever Ties: auto sac vs Mage, Rogue, Priest, a must keep vs Wulven (Lone Wolf, Captured Prey -> try to wait 7 ressources to use it on a PB so you can use his ability, no need to hury most of the time), Gwen and Warriors, if you're lucky you destroy a Blood Frenzy as soon as they cast it, if not, then do as you feel like, Blood Frenzy, if you have board control wait for an Enrage, vs Amber you can also use it on an ally to destroy a weapon without using destruction item. Vs Elemental, it's good to keep on in hand if you have something better to sac (like a Firesnake, Shriek or Tome of Knowledge (<-only if you don't have problem to see your ToK shrieked next turn)), i saw some deck using Life Infusion on Gargoyle, lol)

❆ Dagger of Unmaking: try to keep one in hand if draw early. If your opponent doesn't cat allies, use it on the hero, just keep 1 durability


Strategy: go for board control in early game and deal few damages to the hero, from midle game to late game go for the throat. This deck is near unbeatable if your opponent want to burn you quickly.

			1.2.2.2 Portal Majiya

				1.2.2.2.1 Raphael Majere's "Brutal Portal" Deck (WC Top 8)

http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?16062-Raphael-Majere-s-quot-Brutal-Portal-quot-Deck-(WC-Top-8)
Firstly, major props to iClipse who beat me in Rd 3 of WC finals! His Zhanna is top-notched. He is official the "Slayer of RaphM". I think we've met in a few official Bo3 and I've never beaten him. 

Someone better do a video series on Game 1 and Game 2 that I (Raphael Majere3) played with iClipse! Game 1 shows perfectly how Zhanna should be played vs Mages. Game 2 shows how the mage can adjust and win vs Zhanna. Many key lessons there. Better watch those games now; before iClipse and I play so many games that those games gets wiped off the records. 

(Notes: this deck is designed for WC, not for QM. For beginners, or players interested to play Portal Maj in QM, I will post my deck at the bottom of this post.)

Major THANKS to my Portal Maj teacher, Oblio91, my guild brother, he basically gave the deck to me and taught me a lot that I didn't know; despite being 'supposedly' an expert at Maj.

Ok, onto my deck, 

Majiya x1

Gargoyle x 4
Death Mage x 4
Shadow Knight x 4
Brutal Minotaur x 2
Fireball x 4
Lightning Strike x 4
tome x 3
Portal x 4
Shriek of Vengeance x 3
Acid Jet x 2
Lamb x 3
nova x 2

40 cards 

Shocking facts:

No brut.
No LLN.
Only 3 Tome?!


Explanations (for the intermediate/advanced player)

a. No bruts. They cannot injure gargs and if I cast them late in the game, they might mess up the graveyard order. The key win con combo in this deck is the SK recycler combo (Credits to Blanketeffect for this), and I do NOT want to recycle a silly brut. I want SK to bring back SK or a BM.

b. Why jet over LLN? It cost less, I dont need the draw and more importantly, jet takes out JD, woft, and wiz staff. Enough said.

c. To play my deck well, you need to learn how to play deathrace Maj first. I was placed second in first ever 1.5 Test Server tourney with the "Deathracer Maj". The deck list is here: http://www.shadowera.com/showthread....l=1#post164151

Deck list:

The Gang of 4 x 4: Brut, Garg, Bad Wulf, DMT.
The Burn: FB. LS, Nova "the 12 Burn"
The Draw x 4: Sac Lamb, Research (Research is not good, change it to BS, see below)
Tech: 3 LLN. (specficially for Spelleater bands)



PS: I re-made this deck; removed the Tome and added 4 BS to make the deck even faster. I played it in Swiss Rds of WC. This deck is still good. Very fast. Very fun to play too..

Long story made shorter: you need to learn how to play deathrace maj cos in this Brutal Portal deck, you can switch to deathrace mode. Like how I did in game 2 vs iClipse and managed to win that.

d. Why 3 Tome and 3 Sac lamb?

As oblio told me, sometimes the tome gets destroyed even before it gets used. Plus, when 1 tome is in play, drawing another one is useless. Sac lamb is crucial for deathracing. attack with ally, then sac it. or sac lamb a crippled/frozen/nulled ally. Draw 3.

e. Key combo of this deck

The infinite Recycle combo of SKs. Watch the games of winners of WC Wildcards 1 and 2. Greymouser and AA1 Larus. They play it beautifully. It does not matter if your opponent has a SS bow or Anklebreaker. Those weapons have a dura. Infinite combo does have not a dura.

Also: If your opponent does Retreating on SK or DMT, it causes even more hurt later.

Lastly, if anyone wants to try this in QM, I would suggest the following:

Majiya x1

Gargoyle x 4
Death Mage x 4
Shadow Knight x 4
Brutal Minotaur x 3
Fireball x 4
Lightning Strike x 4
tome x 4
Portal x 4
Shriek of Vengeance x 2
LLN x 2
Lamb x 2
nova x 1
DoU x 1

Play with it, then tuned it according to your preferences.

PS: Why so many "1" and "2"? well, if you like DoU and hate nova since Nova is killing your own allies, then - 1 nova, + 1 DoU. Vice versa, if you like the burn, remove the DoU, etc. The model is made so that you can play and see for yourself what's good and bad. 3 BMs, so that you can see for yourself how the Portalled BM is a nasty nasty pain-in-the-ass for your opponent; when you get more pro; drop to 2 BM. 2 Shrieks cos in QM, the opponents are not as tough as the WC finalist guys.  Blah, blah, you get the idea. Play and adjust the deck accordingly to your needs/ratings.


				1.2.2.2.2 Getting the best out of Portal (in a Majiya deck)

 

Let's start by introducing the card and explain what it does.

Card Name: Portal -> nothing to analyze here
Cost: (4) -> relative high card cost
Type: Mage Ability Support -> Cannot be destroyed by Stop Thief!
Details: Allies you summon for the next 3 turns can attack immediately (Haste)

Actually the text on the card is a bit misleading because Portal only stays on the board for the turn you played it and the next 2 turns (and not 3).

So you have for 3 turns the possibility to attack immediately with your allies if it doesn't get destroyed. Keeping that in mind you should see the following fact:

the more resources you have available and the more allies you have in your hand to use all the resources, the more use you can get out of every turn Portal stays on the board;
having allies with high attack value or high utility synergies very well with this card.

Using this facts Majiya becomes the best hero to use this card.  
Firstly she has access to the shadow allies that are created to have more damage than the human allies.
(nevertheless hasted human allies are also very strong, because they often have high utility -> see Lance)
Secondly Majiya's ability synergies more with Portal than Gravebone's ability, because that extra card you get really helps you to get to higher resources and so get more out of your Portal play.

___________________________________________________________________


So now we have the best hero for our Portal. Now let's find out the best use of Portal in game.
As I said earlier, the more allies you can haste through Portal in your 3 turns, the more you can get out of your card.
Keeping this in mind, playing Portal before you have at least 7 resources seems a bit wasted. Better even 8 resources. So you might ask yourself: "why this exact numbers?".
Hitting the magic number 7 with your resource count means you can play Portal and a useful (3) cost ally in the same turn, to not waste an entire turn of your Portal. In addition to that you can play a (5) fatty and another useful (3) ally the turn after. Same goes in the last turn of your Portal duration too.
If you play against a hero that can destroy the Portal (shadow or priest) it might be even better to wait until 8 resources to play the first Portal. Because then you can play your first Portal + (3) ally in the first turn, let him destroy your Portal and then play your second Portal + fatty in the next turn with 9 resources. If he is not able to destroy your first Portal you can play a fatty + two (3) allies then following it up with 2 fatties.

So you now could be thinking: "that looks amazingly strong, but it surely is hard to pull off and very theoretical!". Well honestly it is neither. Seeing this combo I explained, it's very hard to beat Majiya once she can pull it off successfully. This makes her one of the best high resource / late game heroes in the game.
And the shadow - mage card pool is exactly what she needs to get to this point, making it quite easy to pull this combo off nearly every game.
To see that, lets step back a bit. What do we need exactly? (obvious requirements -> hidden requirements)

High resource count -> board control + survive ability in the early game + card draw
decent amount of allies on your hand -> a lot of draw early- and midgame
A not hopeless board situation + decent amount of hit points -> early game board control

Seeing this should give you some hope, because the shadow mage card pool provides every single requirement.
With her burn spells + her ability Majiya naturally has good early game board control going first and second against most decks. The shadow early game allies also have good survive-abilities (Gargoyle, Brutalis, Bad Wolf) + a decent damage output.  
Combining the draw engines of mages (Tome of Knowledge) with her ability and the draw possibilities the shadow cards provide, we come to enough 1-sided draw to get to a high resource count in nearly every game. You also most likely get at least one, in most games even two, Portal on your hand, before you hit that point where you want to use them.

The last requirement is a bit more tricky. So surely you want to play your allies if you draw them and not want to keep back all your allies just to use them later with Portal. So bad news, you might think. Welcome in the double windmill.
But now the good news: as you might now, you need only 1 card to get out of this dilemma. The almighty Shadow Knight.
With him you can get back your allies you already played and lost in your early games. He has also a very high attack value and thus he has very high synergy with Portal by his own.

To sum this all up: the key cards divided in categories for the best use of Portal are:

Earlygame board control:

Fireball, Lightning Strike, decent amount of low cost allies (1) - (3)

Good draw:

Tome of Knowledge, Sacrificial Lamb or Bad Santa, Shadow Knight, Ley Line Nexus, (Belladonna)

Ally recycle:

Shadow Knight

High Damage allies:

Your favorite fatties, (5) cost allies
(I would not take Plasma Behemoth though, because you need the resources and cannot afford using his ability)

The card that makes everything possible:

Portal


An example for a Majiya deck I build with these rules:

Portal Majiya

1x Majiya
4x Gargoyle
4x Brutalis
4x Death Mage Thaddeus
4x Shadow Knight
3x Molten Destroyer
4x Fireball
4x Lightning Strike
3x Tome of Knowledge
4x Portal
2x Shriek of Vengeance
3x Sacrificial Lamb
2x Ley Line Nexus

So last but not least I want to talk about how you play in the several game stages.


Early game (0 resources - 7 resources):

Try to get and keep board control with burn, your ability and allies. Brutalis, Gargoyle and Death Mage Thaddeus are perfect allies to archive that. Bad Wolf and  Medusil also are very good. Use your burn spells together with the allies on your board to keep the side of your opponent clean.
If you can, drop a Tome on turn 4. Also don't be too reserved to use Sacrificial Lamb on your allies for more draw.
If you can, drop a fatty on turn 5. (don't drop Shadow Knight if you have no (3) ally at the top of your graveyard.)
Play as if you don't run Portal at all in a mid- late-game oriented deck, but try to keep 2 Portals in your hand if possible.
Aim to sac a card every turn. Sometimes its better to skip a sac but this is something you have to find out on your own.

Mid Game (7 resources - 10 Resource):

Use your Portal combo to either clean your opponent's board or to kill his hero.
Keep sacrificing cards.

Late game (10 resource +):

If you get to 10 resource and nobody won the game. you can step back a bit on sacrificing. Of course, higher resources are always good but you begin to run out of cards and so you may want to use all cards you draw.
Use Shadow Knight loop to have infinite access to fatties if he cannot deal with them.  (Shadow Knight loop also counters most mill decks).

			1.2.2.3 Raphael Majere's Maj Deck: "Sacrificial Death Racer"
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?12073-Test-Server-Pop-Tournament-Thursday-5-00-PM-%2817-00%29-GTM-0&p=164151&viewfull=1#post164151
Raphael Majere's Maj Deck: "Sacrificial Death Racer"

I am a consistency freak - which means I always aim for optimal card draw in all decks I make, essentially that meant Warriors in 1.25 onwards. Maj in 1.25 to 1.27. 

That also means I usually like 4 of everything - not 3. I use the either "2 or 4" rule.

Inspiration: YarikaSakin. Other people to thank: Wtzky and Kamman who taught me how to death race when I was in A1.

Allies: 

The Gang of 4: Brut, Garg, Bad Wulf, DMT.

The Burn: FB. LS, Nova

The Draw: Sac Lamb, Research

Tech: 3 LLN. (specficially for Spelleater bands)

Suprise, surprise: No oggy, No fatties.

Strategy: Play death race. 2 modes - Ally rush or pure draw/burn. 

For me, Maj is back as the deathracer - bye bye Elad. GB is ok, but I like Maj's board presence and card draw.

(Notes: GB is v good. Just not as death racer)

Sac Lamb is the key card: I think I won 2 games in tourney purely due to this card. All my opponents played very good decks. GB, Banebow, Zhanna. The only reason I won was due to me being able to death race faster than them, which meant my life was low as well. It does not matter: as long as at the end of game, I am the one with 1 more life than my opponent.

That put Sac lamb at a crucial spot. I can attack with Ally, do a sac lamb; draw 3 cards. and on the same turn, cast another ally out or do more burn. Combined with Maj ability, there is a lot of flexi-options for board control or DD burn to opponent. (late game Combo: attack hero with ally, sac lamb, Nova, board cleared, 3 cards drawn. 7 Resources needed. Next few turns: DD opponent to death)

I lost in finals for the same reason - lance was able to slow me down via Spelleater, Anklebreaker, and poison arrow. Lance took control of the pace of the game, instead of me taking the 'death-racer' lead.

Game 1 was close though. Ray top-decked just the right amt of dmg (Aldoned, Lanced-enhanced hasted Jasmine, 4 dmg) to finish me off. I would have won game 1 otherwise; but that does not matter cos I am likely to lose game 2 and 3 anyways.

			1.2.2.4 Majiya Electrical death
Hi,

This deck took me as far up as 260. And I believe I'm not yet fully realizing it's potential (as in, blame the driver, not the car  )

Idea is to maximize Lightning Strike+ Static Shock damage.
Originally I had 3 PBs instead of 2x IO & 1 Urigon, I swapped them out of interest to try DP cards.
I dropped 3x DoU for 3x Voltar's Ring.

I'd absolutely appreciate any ideas how to further optimize this deck.

			1.2.2.6 Rag-ajiya , a 335 rated beast qm deck (
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?34186-Rag-ajiya-a-335-rated-beast-qm-deck-(-must-see-)
Hi shadow erans :-) , 

So... I am at 335 rating ( top 5 ) using this brutal deck , and also top 87 at score right now which are very hard to keep together , top 5 at rating and top scores at day 22 of season , this means I need to lose about 1 every 5 matches and this is really what happening only to keep rating with playing a lot .... the super star in all of this is that I am doing this with MAJIYA 

Before talking about it here is the deck :-) 
MAJIYA 
Allies : 

4- IRONHIDE KARASH 
4- INFERNAL GARGOYLE 
2- DEATH MAGE THADDEUS
4- PHOENIX URIGON 
3- RAMPANT KRYGON 
3- RAPACIOUS VERMIN 

Abilities :

4- FIREBALL
4- LIGHTENING STRIKE
3- SUPER NOVA
4- BAD SANTA 
2- TRANSMOGRIFICATION CURSE 

Items :

3- TOME OF KNOWLEDGE 


Aim of the super majiya deck : this deck aims to be fast , forget about the control theme shadow images have , this deck is kinda so rushy , you go with a quick and controlled start till you start making allies hit enemy hero , at the right time Santa burn hero just like a rush elad but still the first thing is to control board which can be easily done using the good ally lineup 

TWEAKS : most of matches I didn't want Vermin , calmed me down when I was afraid of spell eater sometimes and I literally faced 0 warrior in my 18 match but it was there to mess with amber .. if you want to change it you can do so but keep the curse , other than this the deck is very well tuned 

SANTA ?? NOT 4 TOK 3 SANTA EVEN?! : Santa .. the only time I feel that I professionally put Santa in a deck , this deck seriously dances with Santa. All heroes fill their hand with their draw engines they have at high rating , so Santa comes very nicely to give them about 1 card and give you 3 , if enemy is very short on draw then summon your TOK and remember majiya ability is also cool ;) 
* I used TOK about 60% of matches I played. most of the time I rely on Santa so don't put in mind the " I must summon TOK " that 95% of people have
* Santa is veryyyyyyy good at burn mode , when enemy HP is low Santa is your BFF 

PLAYING VS MAGES : I really lost 0 matches vs mages including rush , PHOENIX URIGON is a key that made it fairly easy as mages mirror is death race and phoenix consume many mages resources to die. Also Santa at right time is very nice to get spells and reach your spells , phoenix after enemy nova makes many dmg and protects you still... how amazing 

It is the best I reached with majiya and I really hope you enjoy knowing how is majiya still tier 1 , its simpler to have a bigger writeup so I'd just say that I have pleasure to answer questions

			1.3.1.1 Winning with Milkstalker - Complete Guild 
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?17240-Winning-with-Milkstalker-Complete-Guild

Warning: If you are going to attempt to use this style of play, be prepared to be cursed at, yelled at, mocked, scorned, and hated by your opponent. Use at your own risk.

Perhaps the most hated deck in all of Shadow Era. Millstalker gets this notorious reputation because not only are the games "boring", they average about 30-45 minutes long. Some games can extended past 1 hour! Not exactly the "quick game" people are expecting during their 30 minute lunch break.

The reason people play this deck is because it is bloody effective at winning games. Played effectively, expect at least a 300+ rating with a 60%+ winning percentage in quick match. The majority of wins will come against Human deck because those heroes don't typically carry sufficient counters needed to defeat this deck. Many other wins will come from people quiting half way through the match due to frustration, boredom, or lack of time to complete.

Here are the core cards.

For milling:
Bazaaricon
Bad Santaicon

For defense:
What Big Teethicon
Evil Ascendent
Now Your Mine
Captured Preyicon
Crescendoicon

For stalling:
Shadow Fonticon
Rain Delayicon
Full Moonicon

For healing:
Lone Wolficon
Regenerate

Optional:
Shadow Knighticon
Speed Strike
Rabid Biteicon
Master Smithicon

The typical Millstalker deck will be composed of 46-52 cards. Don't be intimidated with this large deck size; you'll need everyone of them. This makes every sacrifice a crucial decision.

Bazaar: You want to play this card ASAP. If possible, play on turn 2. If your opponent is a human mage, hunter, or warrior, you can sack the remaining three. Those heroes can't destroy it. For all other heroes, try to save one in hand in case it becomes destroyed.

Bad Santa: Feel free to sack this card if a bazaar is out. Use it to find your critical Bazaar, Evil Ascendent, stalls.

			1.3.1.2 Drakkon's Lazy Wolf & Hide n' Seek Stalker 
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?8100-Drakkon-s-Lazy-Wolf-amp-Hide-n-Seek-Stalker

Welcome to my thread on "Lazy Wolf".


i. What is Lazy Wolf?
ii. Wulven Heroes
iii. Wulven Cards
iv. Shadow and Neutral Abilities
v. Drakkon's Lazy Wolf & Experimental Version


i. What is Lazy Wolf?


Lazy Wolf is a Wulven deck that focuses on using little to no allies to defeat your opponent. The two main sources of damage that this deck deals is from weapons and mill. Mill damage occurs when your opponent has no cards left in their deck. Each time they would draw they take 1 damage instead. This deck can be played with either hero. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages.



ii. Wulven Heroes


Lets take a look at the two current Wulven heroes you have to choose from.



Darkclaw is a pretty good hero for damage output. His ambush has some uses but is pretty lackluster right now. I'm guessing the usefulness of his ability will likely change in future sets.

Moonstalker is very good at preventing damage. His stall is unmatched and he is perfect for milling your opponent. His ability can only get stronger in time.



iii. Wulven Cards


In this section I'll be reviewing Wulven cards. Keep in mind, these are my opinions. No flaming if you don't agree.


This card is the main source of damage in the deck. Combined with Speed Strike this is some serious damage.
Run 4 copies of this card.

This card is the second piece of the puzzle. It allows you to stike twice per turn, and with Darkclaw's ability that's six damage. Combined with the ambush Darkclaw gives you can take down even some of the bigger threats without taking damage.
Run 3-4 copies of this card.

This is the bread and butter of the deck. It's what holds everything in place. You need this card to keep you alive while your opponents allies and weapons relentlessly attack you.
Run 3-4 copies of this card.

This card is one of the best ally removal abilities in the game. It has a very low cost and removes huge problem allies such as Infernal Gargoyal or Aldon the Braveicon.
Run 0-4 copies of this card.

This is, in my opinion, the best ally control ability in the game. It deals with EVERYTHING.
Run 4 copies of this card.

Now that Eladwin isn't 3/4 of every quick match this card isn't as necessary as it once was. Right now the current issue is allies. So why not run something that disposes of the ally rather than using a bandage?
Run 0-2 of this card.

The old MVP of the deck. It really has little to no use now because Darkclaw's ability doesn't have any form of inherent stall. So it's really just weird and out of place. It's kind of good against mages, but I really feel this card is just for Moonstalker right now.
Run 0-2 of this card.

Kind of a weird card. Personally, before the nerf I thought it was the best card in the game. Now, I've never even thought of using it. But it's actually kind of nice for using bigger allies to move smaller allies out of the way or putting some extra damage on a hero. I see other people using it. But I don't.
Run 0-2 of this card.


iii. Shadow and Neutral Abilities


This card is and will always be one of the key cards for people in Darkclaw. Currently, I'm playing 0 of this card. It's testing well, but at times I'm definitely missing this card. I'm thinking maybe a couple copies would be fine, but not 4. My reasoning is this.. Darkclaw has lost his inherent ability to defend himself, so this ability has basically lost half of the reason it was good. Darkclaw's damage output with this card is obviously high, but right now the decks biggest problem is survivability. So I've cut the Fonts for more control cards.
Run 4 of this card.

			1.3.1.3 Wrath of the Wulven - Competitive Moonstalker 40c deck for 1.5 
http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?8408-Wrath-of-the-Wulven-Competitive-Moonstalker-40c-deck-for-1-5

Behold the Wrath of the Wulven!

Motivation
The Wrath of the Wulven deck is tailored towards making the best of Wulven's inherent abilities and combine them into a strong deck that stands a fighting chance in any matchup. Unfortunately Wulven still lack race specific item destruction and draw mechanic, which keeps them from competing well consistently at very high levels of play.

This deck combines strong Shadow creatures with highly beneficial synergy effects and Wulven's potent creature removal tools. Moonstalker's ability to safeguard himself and his allies from physical attacks at crucial points in time complements the deck very well.

If you made yourself familiar with the deck's play-style and know your opponents basic tactics, this deck carries you easily to a rating of 250 and further. More consistent players should reach 300+ with not too much trouble.


Deck
Hero (1)
Moonstalker

Allies (22)
4 Pack Wolf
2 Brutalis
4 Keldor
2 Death Mage Thaddeus
4 Plasma Behemoth
2 Ogloth the Glutton
4 Shadow Knight

Abilities (17)
4 Now You're Mine
4 Captured Prey
3 Bloodlust
4 Jeweler's Dream
2 Sacrifical Lamb


Strategy
The deck was build using The Rule of Six, giving it different strategic options to choose from, depending on the opponent you are facing. Using Moonstalker's ability wisely to protect key creatures at crucial points in the game and exploiting your opponents weak spot is the main goal of this deck. In this latest iteration for 1.5 I cut back on item destruction, due to the lack of viable options. With 22 creatures, 11 cards to support those and a well balanced resource curve, you will have a very good ratio to apply pressure and keep strong in any match-up.

The deck can be broken down into the following sections, each fulfilling a different goal:

(I) Low cost / swarm creatures - Pack Wolf & Brutalis
(II) Versatile mid cost creatures - Keldor & Death Mage Thaddeus
(III) Hard Hitters - Plasma Behemoth & Ogloth the Glutton
(IV) Creature Control / Removal - Now You're Mine, Captured Prey & Bloodlust
(V) Card Draw - Shadow Knight & Sacrifical Lamb
(VI) Ressource advantage (& ping damage) - Jeweler's Dream (& Death Mage Thaddeus)

On card draw
As Wulven lacks race specific card draw and the usual choices present as much benefit to your opponent as to yourself, I decided to keep it expensive and creature heavy with 4 Shadow Knight, adding in 2 Sacrifical Lamb for strategic use later in the game. As the deck features 10 high cost allies and 10 opportunities to use up resources with creatures, you do not need to play a card every round (e.g. using Keldor and Plasma Behemoth special abilities and not playing a card is totally fine). Jeweler's Dream helps keeping a ressource advantage, mitigating the need to play a lot of resources, again saving cards in your hand. 6 resources suffice most of the time.

On item destruction
No item destruction seems crazy, but thinking it through it does make sense. Every creature and weapon attack can be seen as a form of item destruction vs weapons and armour. Yes, there are abilities you won't be able to deal with directly, but indirectly by applying insane amounts of pressure by playing creatures non-stop and safeguarding them. I made the experience that you can overwhelm your opponent in most cases with this strategy.

Pending on what opponent you face, the strategy can vary in different aspects.


Basic synergies & tactics

    Use Moonstalker's ability to protect key creatures like Plasma Behemoth or multiple creatures if you plan on using Bloodlust the next round
    Use Shadow Knight to revive Plasma Behemoth, Ogloth the Glutton or chain revive Shadow Knight
    Use Death Mage Thaddeus entry ping damage together with a previously played creature to finish off an ally
    Use Jeweler's Dream to the same goal and or to reduce item durability of your opponent
    Use Jeweler's Dream when it allows you to play additional useful cards. (e.g. when played in round 4 attack a Kristoffer and use the freed up resources to Now You're Mine an Aldon, play a Pack Wolf or inrease the damage of T3 Keldor to 4 to deal with almost any T3 ally on the board)
    Use Plasma Behemoth and Death Mage Thaddeus vs. stealthed creatures or during Rain Delay
    Use Keldor's ability to kill off strong cost 3 creatures and for additional damage output
    Use Plasma Behemoth, Death Mage Thaddeus and Pack Wolf vs. Warriors and Crippling Blow
    Use Sacrifical Lamb wisely to kill off useless creatures, send a near dead creature to the grave to get revived by Shadow Knight or buff Ogloth the Glutton
    Use Ogloth the Glutton on enemy or even allied creatures to buff him and send creatures to the grave (possible Shadow Knight resurrection)
    Play Pack Wolf preferably if you have at least 2 in your starting hand to utilize its self-buff
    Use Bloodlust to either seal the deal or to kill off key creatures
    Keep Captured Prey for creatures with special abilities, like Plasma Behemoth or Shadow Knight
    Use Now You're Mine against buffed low cost creatures or cornerstone creatures like Aldon the Brave or Jasmine Rosecult
    Be mindful of keeping some Hard Hitters on your hand vs Mages and Priests with mass removal

http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?23992-Dancing-Darkclaw-mixed-allies-and-weapons-deck-Very-fast-and-deadly!

I repost my article which originally appeared as a reply in this thread:


First of all, it's not my own deck idea, I've seen it watching a QM and I really liked it and wanted to try it myself. I'm impressed, how well this works. Credits go to the original author of the idea.

Deck:

I call it "Dancing Darkclaw", because Darkclaw equipped with Speedstrike and Jeweler's dream really seems to dance in a furious fast dance and together with his allies lets his opponent's blood just splash around.

Hero:
Darkclaw

Allies:
3 Death Mage Thaddeus
4 Shadow Knight
3 Morbid Acolyte
3 Tiger Wulf

Abilities:
4 Captured Prey
2 Now You're Mine
3 Speedstrike
2 Sacrificial Lamb
2 Shriek of Vengeance
4 Blood Moon

Weapons:
4 Jeweler's Dream
3 What Big Teeth
2 Spectral Sabre


Play:
T1: Nothing
T2: Blood Moon
T3: Speedstrike
T4: Jeweler's Dream
T5: Tiger Wulf or Shadow Knight, 2* attack + DMT, CP or whatever
T6: ....

This deck really revolves around the combo of Speedstrike and Jeweler's Dream. With Speedstrike you can renew 4 resources per turn and cast your allies and abilities really fast. The Darkclaw's shadow ability on JD makes the weapon attacks able to kill fatties or damage the opponent's hero significantly. It does well in both early and late game, playing first or second.


Card Explanation:
DMT: To damage armored heroes, Ironhide Karashes, Wulven Savages etc., you know.
SK: You can loop them or recycle the Tiger Wulfs, solid strong ally.
Morbid Acolyte: To bypass Aeons and other protectors, stealh etc., really versatile ally...
Tiger Wulf: Another versatile ally, can destroy almost anything, can be looped with SK, good for Sacrifitial Lamb after use.

CP: To neutralize stronger allies you can't deal with another way.
NYM: To kill low cost allies annoying on the board.
Speedstrike: Crucial ability to maximize the use of Jeweler's Dream and the DC's shadow ability.
Sacrificial Lamb: Additional card draw, to maximize potential of Tiger Wulf, to make some use of crippled allies etc., I find myself saccing it often though.
Shriek: To get rid of Tomes, Staffs, Antimatters etc.
Blood Moon: Great main draw, useful in both early and late game.

JD: The second key card, gives the deck deadly power.
WBT: Good and unlimited substitute, when you don't have JD.
Spectral Sabre: Universal card, I use it as a weapon or attachement destruction about 50/50. The damage of 2 can really help to win the game.


Saccing: Duplicities and cards you don't need against (or already have and can't be countered by) specific opponent or in specific situation. Occasional allies, CP and weapons according to

			1.4.1.1 Morbius' killer Baduruu deck 2
Baduruu sure has come a long way, from being a weakest hero in the game when I published my first killer Baduruu deck, to being in the top half now and certainly the most utilized ranger. DP card pool has resolved most of his weaknesses and given him a lot of new options. Here is my best Baduruu deck so far, I hover around 290 rating with it.

Allies:
2x Infernal Gargoyle
2x Death Mage Thaddeus
2x Wendith Eagle-eye (attacks without retaliation and boosts bow damage up to 4)
1x Wolven Savage (saves you vs thieves)
1x Morbid Acolyte
2x Darkwood Wraith (saves you vs Elementalis and rushers)
1x Plasma Behemoth

Most of these allies are tough buggers who wont die from a single fireball. Remember that you draw 3 cards from using Sacrificial Lamb on any of them. 

Abilities:
2x Shriek of Vengeance
2x Poison Arrow
1x Acid Jet
1x Shadow Font
2x Ley Line Nexus
2x The Perfect Shot
1x Nocturnal Advantage

2x Enchanted Forest
3x Snare Trap

Hero items:
2x Pride of the Mountain

All together 44 cards with hero. You can cut or add some, based on the heroes you are facing the most. As it stands here, it is a very balanced deck with no huge weaknesses against any hero. Some match ups are very good for this deck, thieves being on top of the list, while you will generally fare worse against Darkclaw, Majiya and the warriors. Your biggest problem will be the lack of the reliable draw, so as usual with my ranger decks, you have several different draw mechanisms. Have fun owning!

			1.5.1.1 Amber - Reign of Champions
Introduction

So I decided to aim for top 100 in season 12 namely because it was a shorter season being only 28 days. I developed and used an Ambericon deck throughout most of the season. The deck served me well as it allowed me to be competitive with most match ups.

At the end of the season, my rating was 315 with win rate of 62%. My rating fluctuated between 320 to 330 throughout most the season. I purposely did not start playing with this deck until I hit a rating of 280 so as not to inflate my win percentage. I played a total of 253 games and 224 of them was with this deck. I finished with a rank of 77 with a score of 14,9540.

I named this deck "Ambericon - Reign of Champions" because a) the obvious play on the word "Rain" and b) I believe this deck has the best and most versatile allies out of all the human allies in the DP/COTC set - they are all champions in my book!

I thought it would be nice to share with you the deck itself, the rationale behind the build as well as some information on the different match ups I faced. So here it is! Enjoy!

39 cards + hero


Build Raionale

Jeweler's Dreamicon & Blood Frenzyicon - this combination is what makes Amber the beast that she is today! With Blood Frenzy, you draw 2 cards per turn - this gives you card advantage. With Jeweller's Dream, you get 2 resources renewed - this helps you cast more cards which grants you tempo gain. With both card advantage and tempo gains, this then helps you regain or maintain board advantage. Sure you do lose 1 hit point per turn... but this is negligible early game. For more information on these concepts, check out "Converting one advantage to another" by Qazzaq
Champion of Irum: my ideal play is T3 Blood Frenzy so I need a T2 ally who will survive T3 solo often. Champion of Irum does this for me
Jasmine: I faced a lot of Moonstalkers and so i needed a way to deal with stealth. Jasmine helped me do this and she is a great T3 drop if I miss T3 Blood Frenzy
Aldon: he gives me the extra damage I need. His ability is amazing when you have multiple allies on board
Seductress: with Jeweler's Dream, I can comfortably match the amount of resources I have to my opponent. This often allows Seductess to trigger her ability and help me regain board control having lost it on T3 Blood Frenzy
Sandworm: I faced a lot of Ambers and Mages and so Sandworm worked well against both
Aeon: works so well against all heroes especially against Moonstalkericon as he could protect Jasmine from Now Your Mine
Bad Santa: if I do not have Blood Frenzy nor has my opponent played a card by T2, I will play Bad Santa on T2 to dig for a Blood Frenzy to play on T3. Bad Santa is also good for digging for certain cards needed urgently like an Enrage or a weapon
Crippling Blow & Retreat: both very useful on T2 going second and T4 with Jeweller's Dream. Crippling Blow is the better disable card generally so normally I will go 4/2 split. But since many Moonstalkers were stealthing Plasma Bohemoths and Tiger Wulfs ... I needed more retreats to counter this hence the 3/3 split
Smashing Blowicon: very useful against all classes T4 onwards except maybe Mages, hence only 2 included
Enrage: useful late game and against Mages
Spectral Sabre: such a versatile card! Use it to remove Blood Frenzy, Rapid Fireicon, Enrage and Speedstrikeicon... use it to free allies from disabling attachments... use it as a weapon!



The Match Ups

Eladwenicon
Record: 40 games played with a 60% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: a mixture of rush similar to Peithoson's Eladwen Red Deck Wins and control similar to Justicar's WC2013 Wildcard Qualifier Winning Eladwen Deck
Strategy: try to keep a weapon in hand and Sandworms on board as Eladwen struggles to deal with both these threats. Try to hang onto the Enrage or a Bad Santa to dig for the Enrage

Moonstalkericon
Record: 28 games played with a 54% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: allied based Moonstalker similar to Maskee's MS Dances with Tigers. There were a few Millstalkers similar to the one in Preybird's Moonstalker Breakdown
Strategy: obtain board control whilst countering Moonstalker's stealth ability on allies with Retreat, Crippling Blow, Seductress' summon ability and Jasmine's ability

Amber
Record: 28 games played with a 71% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: decks were similar to mine but more aggro with the use of Fleet Footed Messenger
Strategy: use Spectral Sabre to deny their Blood Frenzy draw and to use Smashing Blow to destroy their Jeweller's Dream.

Zhannaicon
Record: 21 games played with a 43% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: a mixture of Zhannaicon decks such as Klytz's popup winning Zhanna and SES Aphex's 55 deck Goddess Zhanna
Strategy: do not get behind in card advantage by a) getting rid of Zhanna's draw engines i.e. Wizent's staff and Elizabeth Winterborn b) not committing too many allies to the board so that the Tidal Waveicon does not trade well

Lanceicon
Record: 19 games played with 58% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: standard Lanceicon similar to the Lance in Preybird's Lance breakdown
Strategy: make good use of Retreat, Crippling Blow, Jasmine and Seductress to both keep board and counter Lance's hasted stealth allies. If you are about to lose board mid to late game, then consider rushing his health down instead of trying to regain board. Save Smashing Blow for Anklebreakericon if possible

Baduruuicon
Record: 18 games played with 67% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: semi resource denial decks similar to SES Night's 310 Baduruu
Strategy: both Blood Frenzy and Smashing Blow are crucial to this match up. Crippling Blow is useful for that one enemy ally that the Grundler's Double is relying on for draw. Sandworm is helpful for keeping board control and wearing down weapons.

Majiyaicon
Record: 14 games played with a 64% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: portal Majiyaicon similair to Raph's DP Portal Majiya
Strategy: try to have both a weapon in hand and Sandworm out. Make good use of Crippling Blow to halt any Shadow Knighticon loop. Try to hang onto the Enrage or a Bad Santa to dig for the Enrage

Zaladaricon
Record: 14 games played with a 64% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: Zaladaricon with Soul Reaper and Shadowvein similar to Yvan Antoine's Shadowveinicon Zaladar
Strategy: flood the board with allies with Sandworm being the most useful. Save Smashing Blow for Shadowvein. Try not use Enrage in case he steals it with Morphic Armoricon

Banebowicon
Record: 9 games played with a 89% win rate
Main deck(s) faced: standard Banebowicon similar to Index's Wrath of the Aggro Forest
Strategy: flood the board with allies and try to get Aeon to stick. Save Smashing Blow for bows and Wrath of the Foresticon.

Other Heroes
Results: 37 games played with a 65% win rate
Heroes faced: Serenaicon, Victoricon, Jericho, Borisicon, Ter Adunicon, Gravebone, Loganicon, Elementalisicon and Gwen



Concluding Remarks

I think it's important to note that this is not a tournament deck, it is a QM deck. In tournaments, your goal is win at every stage against all opponents - losses must be avoided if you are to progress. In quick match, your goal is to win consistently - losses are okay so as long as you make up for it with more wins.

Hence this deck doesn't have the odd Artful Squireicon for the odd Millstalker nor the odd Braxnorian Soilder for Lance. It simply concentrates on doing well against the Eladwen, allied Moonstalker and Amber; whilst still aiming to compete well with Zhanna, Lance, Baduruu, Majiya, Zaladar and Banebow.

Which leads me to reiterate how the allies in this deck are all champions! They are all so useful in many situations! 

I hope you enjoyed this! I'd be happy to answer any questions and receive any feedback.

Hi. Here is my another Zhanna deck. 

Previous Zhanna that I posted here was aggro heavy. You can go get the board with ice storm, while having Priest's almighty tools to control the game. This deck is control heavy, meaning that you let your opponent be the beatdown and you stay passive until you get to finish the game.

This deck might be difficult to play for new players as you need to know what your opponent is doing. But once you know about many heroes and decks, you can play this deck without thinking too much because this deck has a golden strategy just like rush Eladwenicon. 

I play this deck when I feel like I just wanna play SE without using my head but not quite in the mood for rush Elad

This deck is all about gaining advantage.


You have 4 retreat, 4 banish, 4 TW = 12 ability cards to control the board, while you also have 4 Jasmine and 3 Seductress for extra ally control. Too much? Maybe. But this makes your sac choice so much easier. 

Shutting down your opponent's draw is the first thing you need to do. And then get you draw engine on the board. From there, you can counter every card opponent plays, thereby leaving them nothing to fight with. Use Banish for 1:1 trade, TW is for 2 for 1 trade, while you are drawing 2 or 3 cards every turn. Accumulate hand advantage first, then turn that into board advantage when your opponent has not many ways to counter.

Type: Control
Resource: 7~9
Speed: Slow and Passive until you win the game.




Cards

3cc allies here can be swapped/mixed to what you like. 

Jasmine
Solid 3/4 and strong ability. Never less than 3 in any DP priest deck imo.

Seductress
Since KotGD have 4 atk, Aldonicon is less important here. Seductress alone can buy a lot of time for you to cast control card while presenting a body on the board, forcing your opponent to deal with it. Also, nice alt way to deal with steadfast allies other than Tidal Wave.

Other possibilities are,

Aldon
As I wrote above, since this deck's main finisher has 4 atk, and also 1 ping damage from Wizent's Staff is usually enough, Aldon's +1 boost is less important. But still, being able to buff KotGD to kill IG/MA/PB in 1 hit is nothing to ignore. 

FFM
Actually pretty cool in this deck because in any control deck, more ways to make your hand better is never a bad thing. Especially, with this deck, you need to have correct answers for opponent's play throughout the game. FFM greatly helps you to reach the card you need in the situation. Also, KP+FFM ftw. 


KotGD
Pretty powerful. Game finisher No 1. I don't say it is absolutely better than Ravenicon or Brax soldier, but KotGD allows you to use Aldon's slot for something else. He is better than Raven to face Jasmine, Aldon or DMT. Plus, he has to be killed in 1 turn or Zhanna can gain 6 point advantage. So he actually has a good survivability when Zhanna has SE stock. Overall, KotGD fits well in Zhanna control deck.


Elizabeth
4 copies because you need a massive draw power. You can swap 1 Elizabeth with TO if you like, but never bring less than 3 copies. 

Aeon
Finisher No 2. He requires your opponent to have pretty specific cards to counter: Dragon's tooth/MC etc. Note that getting a retreat on Aeon is good for you because opponent have used 1 card and did not gain much tempo since Zhanna have multiple ways to counter allies on the board that came along with the retreat. You must kill opponent draw engine first, then getting an Aeon retreated hurts your opponent more. +1 Aeon, -1 KotGD works too.


Tidal Wave
Big advantage gaining card. Auto 4 in this type of deck.

Banish
Quite expensive, but it gives your opponent no hand advantage, unlike retreat. Since it costs 4 resource to cast, your aim is to get to 7 or 8 resource for Banish + something (Or even double Banish!)

Retreat
Cheap and good. Not as great as Banish, in terms of diminishing opponent's hand advantage, but Zhanna needs 2cc ability cards to cast on t2 to delay opponent's rush. 

FP
Best item destruction card in the game. It is a bit easier to use FP on Tome or DoU against portal majiya than normal Zhanna build, because Banish can take care of SK portal combo to a degree. Auto 4 in passive control deck.

Mass Purification
Another advantage gaining card. MP is like TW against certain decks. +1 MP and -1 retreat/banish for attachment heavy meta. 

Forgiveness
AUTO 1 include!


Wizent staff
Draw more without using your precious resource! W.Staff = BF if you like.

KP
Finisher No 3.


Plays

t4 Staff, t5 TW, t6 retreat+Elizabeth, t7 Banish + Jas.
t4 draw engine, t5 retreat + FP, t6 TW, t7 retreat + KotG, t8 double Banish etc.


Have fun!


Any questions?



P.S.
You can do almost the same with Jerichoicon. He cannot use Elizabeth and KotGD well, but he can exclude MP so the deck will be more lean and probability of drawing key cards goes up.

This deck is quite difficult to play.
You need to know when to go for the board and when to give up and Tidal Wave.
However, the deck is capable of winning without using a single TW if played correctly.
So many synergies in this deck, so fun to play. Knowing what your opponent's optimal play in what turn is crucial.

Type: Control
Resource: 6~7
Speed: Can be fast but usually slow.



Champion of Irum
Great with Zhanna's ability. Always drop this on T2 when you have it in hand.
CoI - Aldon can punish opponent Karash when going second. 
CoI - L Seductress is great against human when going second.
CoI - Ice Storm can take out enemy Karash and DMT. A clear board is there.
Also, you can play CoI with TW at 7 resource.
Attack with him, and heal him with Zhanna's ability on t3.
He is unique so I only included 3. But really, if you get him on t2, your probability to win rises by quite a lot.

Jasmine
Best t3 play when going first.
If you managed to keep her behind Aeon, you won the game there.
No better 3cc ally than her, so 4. 

Aldon
He became more important in DP, mainly because of Karash.
Himself is not great against Karash but he is the second optimal t3 drop when going first.

L Seductress
the only way to deal with allies with Steadfast from your hand except TW.
I don't know how many times she saved me in games. Keep her in hand if you have enough allies on board, otherwise, play her. It is always better to have allies on your board in this deck.

Elizabeth
People still don't know how to deal with her. She is sooo dangerous.
While health 5 is not easy to kill in one turn, Zhanna can heal her up for more draws.
t4 Liz when going first is very strong. 

Sandworm
For me, Sandworm is better than Ravenicon as I want to play 5cc on its own.
Raven, or KotGD sometimes need to be backed up with a retreat - Sandworm does not need it.
It can do nothing against Karash though. That's why I decided to include Ice Storm.

Brax Soldier
Just there to take care of Portalicon Majiyaicon. Better than Sandworm against Lanceicon. 
3 Sandworm instead of 2 and 1 Brax Soldier is more consistent and that's what I usually use in QMs.

Aeon
Drop him after your opponent uses ability cards on Elizabeth/Sandworms.
Elizabeth - Sandworm - Aeon - KP is how I win 30% of times.



Tidal Wave
Arguably Priest's most powerful card.
However, it is always better not to rely on TW, because playing TW means giving up a turn and opponent can start playing more threats.
I believe in my deck and my draw so I usually sac TW. But for those who are not sure how my deck works should hold this in hand until you know when to sac TW.

Ice Storm
My biggest 'discovery' in DP. This card won me so many games. Totally underrated in every scene of the game. Trust me, this card is so good. Priests have had difficult times dealing with stealth allies. This is the answer. 
Sandworm + ice storm is a great surprise as your opponent do not expect to see a board wipe.
Great against Karash, W.savage, as well as stealth allies. Coincidentally, they ALL have only 2 health (except Erikaicon with 3 but no ambush so W.staff will deal the extra)!!! Or from a different perspective, this is a mini KP for 3 cost!

Focused Player
As I said, I believe in my deck and draw. So I only included 3.
This is a very powerful card and it has always been the one of reasons why I choose Zhanna to play in competitive scenes.
Since it is so powerful, you might want 4.

Retreat
One of MUST-INCLUDE card in any priest decks really.
Cheaper than new card Banish, and it does almost the same thing (for this deck anyway)
Knowing how to use retreat is not only crucial for this deck but for Shadow Era.

Forgiveness
One of the best card Priest got in DP. 
The idea to include 1 forgiveness came from my friend, BP Hachi. So the full credit goes to him. Thanks!
His idea to include this card have made my deck possible - I rarely have 4 of the same cards in the deck because I can always get it back with this. This is 4th (3rd for KP and Aeon) copy of any cards in the deck. Doesn't it sound amazing?

Note: On the Test Server, opponent's resource destruction messed the resource pile and I could not get the card I was supposed to get. I am not sure if this is the case in the live server but please be careful.

Mass purification
I rarely use it. But attachment destruction is good to have at least one in any deck anyway. Nevertheless, it has won me games several times against Wulven/Warrior heros. Also, this is the only way to remove Into the Foresticon.



The King's Pride (KP)
Very expensive for new players But you need this (2 is fine )
I know mage/zalader/banebow hate this card.

Wizent's staff
Main draw engine. Also this is a weapon which enables Zhanna to attack. Get full use out of it. Especially since Zhanna can heal up the damage. Use this as an additional 1 damage.
e.g. Jas + W.staff to take out 4 health ally. Zhanna attack to reduce the durability of Anklebreakericon/Dagger of Unmakingicon
But don't use too much SE when facing against a rush deck.



Have fun! But don't give up because you only played it for 5 times and didn't go well 
You need a lot of practice with this deck. Trust my build and play with it for 100 times 

Any questions?


Addition:
Some scenes I encountered on QM I think worths noting.

Kairos - TW or Seduce.
Serenaicon or Baduruuicon (with Night Prowlericon) - they discard (steal) a card from your hand at t5
Moonstalkericon - When this deck starts to shine, MS starts to hide.
Rush Elad - Without Healing Touchicon, you need to take care of their ally rush. Tools are CoI, Seductress, Ice Storm and W. Staff.
Majiya Portal S.Colossus - Don't expect KP to stay long.

			1.6.1.4 My World Champion winning Zhanna deck
Hello everyone!

Since I promised to post the deck, I have to deliver, so here it is.

First, and most important, the list:

1x Zhannaicon - 42 cards (Hero included)

Allies - 18
4x Jasmine Roseculticon
3x Aldon the Braveicon
4x Tainted Oracleicon
4x Raven Wildhearticon
3x Aeon Stormcallericon

Abilities - 17
4x Healing Touchicon
4x Tidal Waveicon
4x Focused Prayericon
1x Resurrectionicon 

4x Retreaticon

Weapons/Armors - 6
4x Wizent's Stafficon
2x King's Prideicon

Question: Why did I choose this deck for the WC?
Well, I've said it in the interview that's online, but obviously not everyone heard that. The reason I chose this deck is because it has no unwinnable matchups. Of course it has difficult matchups (I'll explain below) but in every matchup it's possible to go to at least 40-50% winrate. Of course, some matchups will require some experience, some proper thinking and the right saccing. I think most other decks really have a deck, you REALLY DON'T WANT TO FACE. Think as Zaladaricon a Gwen deck, Gwen with Moonstalkericon, Moonstalker with mages, mages with Ambericon, and so forth. With Zhanna that isn't really there, and that's why I made that pick.

Question: Is this an easy deck to play?
No. Not at all. Be prepared to lose a lot of games with it, if you want to try this deck out. It has a lot of different matchups that require a completely different approach, and you won't know all of these from the start.

Question: Can you explain the deck a bit?
Sure! I'll explain it on a card by card basis.

Jasmine Rosecult
Really, I have no idea how many games she has won me already, but it's uncountable. Her ability alone can win games. Protect her behind an Aeon and you're golden. Once she hits the board, your opponent HAS to deal with her, or he loses the game.

Aldon the Brave
Well, he's more there to add that extra bit of damage when you need it, and to have a body on turn 3 than anything else. Still, a good ally that can do a lot, still, it's best to play him after you already have something on the field, except if you want to draw fire away from your hero, and you have nothing else to play.

Tainted Oracle
A great card! Allows draw, makes it so your hero gets hit less, can be killed by your own deck if he gets disabled. All around great ally to have, and great draw 'engine'. By having 4 of those, and 4 times Wizent's Staff it's almost guaranteed to have some form of draw on turn 4. 

Raven
A completely underrated ally in the current meta. Having Raven is great vs Moonstalker (yes, you read that right). A lot of players use Sandwormicon nowadays, just because of the fact that it's a good ally. It's great versus Anklebreakericon, immune to dots, great versus Dagger of Unmakingicon and so on. Well yes, that's completely true, but it's a defensive ally. Playing it on an empty board doesn't guarantee board control, while playing a Raven does. Also does more damage. Can kill 5 health allies with KP and can still survive a nova.

Aeon
Mister bad-ass. Great cards versus decks that can't just instantly kill allies. Think about Banebowicon, warriors, even Lanceicon and Serenaicon sometimes. Drop him on the board as soon as you can. Even vs Elemental decks. Having your Aeon Mind Controlled doesn't hurt more than having your Jasmine Mind Controlled. So it almost never hurts to have him on the board. 

Healing Touch
Completely underrated and one of my favorite cards. It's just great in a LOT of matchups. Vs warriors it removes Crippling Blowicon, versus wulven it removes Captured Prey, versus mages it helps to stay alive a lot longer, same goes for Zaladar who tends to try to deathrace a lot. Negates Eladwenicon's ability. Removes distraction.
Ever played vs a Lance who hasted Ravens? Well that's what this card basically does. "Here, Crippling Blow, now your raven is completely useless! - Healing Touch, and Raven is immediately ready to attack."

Tidal Wave
The obvious card. Though, not as easy to use as people think. The trick is to get as most value out of the card as possible. For example, if you see your opponent has 2 allies on the board, and you have none, but he only has 4-5 damage output on the board, drop an Aeon instead and try to draw more fire to him, while at the same time try to keep your draw going. If he goes for the Aeon, good for you since it allows you to be aggressive, if he doesn't that means he committed more for the board, so now you'll get more out of your Tidal Wave. 

Focused Prayer
Use this card especially to take out draw engines. Vs mages though you might want to keep one in hand at all times, because it can save your life if you get to destroy a Portalicon with it, or a Dagger of Unmaking, which by the way can ruin your day. 

Resurrection 
Well, the card isn't used a lot, so the deck is probably better without this card. Though, I added the card to my deck because of mirror matchups and Millstalker. Since I never encountered these, I never got to play this card, so it's probably best to cut this card from the deck.

Retreat
Well yes, the obvious board control card. It's especially good on later turns. Play Tidal Wave on turn 6/7, and next turn you combine a retreat with a Raven or an Aeon. That wins you games right there.

Wizent's Staff
The basic draw engine. When fighting versus death racing decks, try not to rely on it too much, since it slows down your healing and thus you won't last as long. Which is the end what you aim for, lasting long.

King's Pride
Only use this card in desperate moments OR when the attack boost allows you to take down an ally you otherwise wouldn't have been able to take out in one blow. When you have an active ally on the board, and you can play a Kings Pride, it's often good game.

Question: Can you explain how you sac your cards with this deck?
I can. But I won't. Trial and error is the way to learn. If you want to learn how this deck works, I expect people to have the time to learn and understand the deck. 

Question: What are the weaknesses of this deck?
As I said, there isn't one HERO that is a weak spot, there are however deck ARCHETYPES that can be problematic. The most common and the most seen problematic deck is rush. Eladwen rush, Amber rush, Zaladar rush can all be quite problematic. The key is on trying to let your allies take some hits instead of your hero, keeping your draw up with Tainted Oracle and only Wizent's Staff if you have no other choice. Try to survive till the opponent runs out of steam (which he will if you focus down his draw engine, or high damage weapons), and then take the board with big fat allies. 

Another problematic things is Dagger of Unmaking. The best ways of destroying it is by spamming your 3cc allies and using Wizent's Staff to run the durability out, or obviously just to destroy it by using Focused Prayers. Be advised though, that destroying it with Focused Prayers may mean that you won't have one for destroying possible portals or Tome of Knowledges, so keep that in mind.

Last problematic thing is Shadow Knighticon. If you can't break the loop, you'll lose, that's for sure. So you have to try and break that loop. Your best ways in doing so is by playing either Jasmine or Raven. Both work equally well, so keep that in mind.

For the rest, I hope you enjoyed my explanation, and if you have any questions, I'll try and answer them in the thread. But please refrain from saying that you played the deck for 5 games and lost all of them, because you'll need at THE VERY LEAST 20 games to get the hang of the deck. 

P.S.: If you see any typing errors or other things that aren't correct, just say so and I'll update the OP

			1.6.2.1 2.0 Jericho "Black Sheep"
(a.k.a Advantage Me)

Hi all,

Ive been having a lot of fun and success with Jerichoicon lately, so I figured Id share my take on this underused and (really) underestimated hero:

Jericho

4 x Champion of Irum
4 x Jasmine Roseculticon
3 x Aldon the Braveicon
3 x Layarian Seductress
3 x Aeon Stormcallericon
3 x Elizabeth Winterborn

3 x Healing Touchicon
4 x Tidal Waveicon
4 x Focused Prayericon
3 x Retreaticon!
2 x Kings Prideicon

4 x Wizent's Stafficon

40 cards + hero

Optional:

+2 Ice Stormicon
-1 Healing Touch

Why Jericho?

This no doubt is your first question. At a glance theres nothing here to tie me specifically to Jericho, no attachments, no Lingering Essence, no trickiness. I chose Jericho at the time simply because of the meta, there were a lot of Ambers and Banebows around, and very little mage rush. Jericho was a good surprise package in a meta like this, as he can easily and reliably shut down Ambericon with little tempo loss to himself, and hes generally a tough prospect for Banebowicon provided he can keep Banes draw down. However Ive been genuinely surprised with his effectiveness against all heroes (gone 4-0 vs Portal Majiyaicon for example!)

Jerichos ability is also useful for freeing up your disabled and crippled allies, and just generally keeping them in the fight for longer than they have any right to be. When you factor in the negative effect part of his ability (which so many seem to forget), you realise Jericho is able to impact almost every hero in the game.

Draw

Lizzy is probably the next query you have, particularly as I dont have Zhannaicons heal to keep her undamaged. In my experience as long as you have other allies on the table, Lizzy is left alone as people go after the more immediate threats. This means that she will almost always equal or better Tainted Oracleicons draw, and heading into the late game with an Aeon shielding her she gives massive draw power. Coupled with Wizents (which Jericho can really exploit!) you can even outdraw warriors, which is a scary prospect in and of itself. In fact in one game with this I had decked myself while my opponent still had 20 cards left!

Quite simply this deck breeds draw and card advantage.

Tactics

Basically this deck plays like a more proactive Zhanna. You need early presence to soak up damage in preparation for your late game blitzing, and this is where Champ and Seductress really shine. In fact your early game control package is good enough to keep you in the fight in many cases and I have won games without using Tidal Wave at all. While Seductress seems counter intuitive given that Priests like high resources, she is worth her weight in gold in the early game, and in late game shes still a 4/5 with Kings Pride out which is nothing to be sniffed at. 

When it all comes down to it your goals are to control the board and more importantly to control the draw. When all goes to plan your opponent will have 1-2 cards in hand to your 6, and will be drawing 1 per turn to your 3. Thats when this deck steamrolls with ally after ally, and if Aeon dies with 3 in the deck youll have another ready. Healing Touch is a very important card against mages and Zaladaricon to give you enough breathing room to allow your superior late game to take off.

Conclusion

Thats my Jericho. Hes just like an old Volvo, solid and reliable with no fancy trimmings.

P.S: I was tempted to call the deck "Be Numb" 

P.P.S: If you're curious, I've been putting this deck through it's paces on ASF Preybird (bar that one match where I used Zal for old times sake).

			1.6.2.2
		1.6.3 Threbin

			1.6.3.1 ragosonos's 338 rated threbin 2.90 meta destruction deck
Hi dear wonderful community , 

So.. this deck gave me 100% win rate today and I believe its hard to be defeated , 

What everyone will do is .. use attachment based deck or insanely tech vs attachments but I choose another way .. reasonable tech vs every single deck with reasonable good amount of draw and it worked so nicely 

THREBIN 

Allies : 
4-AVENGER OF THE FALLEN 
4-GUARDIAN OF UNAXIO 
4-SINDAROK APPRENTICE 
4-TEMPLAR CHAMPION
3-JUSTICAR ALYSIA 

Abilities : 
4-FOCUSED PRAYER 
4-TIDAL WAVE 
2-MASS PURIFICATION 

Items : 
4-WIZENT STAFF 
4-SCRIPTURES OF THE RIGHTEOS 
3-ROD OF SMITING 



the deck simply have a way to beat every single deck in the current meta and card choices are so obvious and efficient

How to deal with : 

Warriors ( easy ) : after you take the board put on many allies which amber usually cripple due to high HP of all my allies then suddenly MP to destroy him OR early MP to remove his bf and save a crippled ally which will destroy enemy early game ( vs amber 4 focused prayer will help a lot) ( vs vess MP is destructive ) ( vs tala tidal plus Templar champ is almost a board lock at late game ) 

Moon stalker ( easy ) : since last version .. keep fighting with him till u suddenly tidal plus champ and its GG indeed 

Darkclawicon ( very easy ) : in terms of solo darkclaw which likely 95% of dc now your MP and focused prayer is GG 

Blood fang ( easy ) : tidal and rod of smiting will make his allies clueless unless its something like my deck posted in wulven section which fucks up my resources but its not really found in QM a lot. And focused prayer on wotf will destroy enemy draw 

Mages ( medium) : guardian of unaxio helps a big lot and rod of smiting helps you alooot and make u rush rush mages

Priests ( medium ) : this deck is so aggro which makes it so good vs priests and 4 focused prayer helps a lot to destruct draw ( keep 1 for tkp ) 

Zaladaricon - praxix ( easy ) : their draw is destroyed by FP and my rod makes it so easy to rush them out and ability works great as their allies are low HP allies in most of decks ( all what I've seeen ) 

Elementalisicon ( auto win ) : tidal wave plus allies in late game is a GG and rod is killing his allies also ... its so easy no need to explain what priests in general do vs this dude 

Banebowicon ( easy ) : FP on his wotf then tidal and weapons will be easy domination 

Baduruuicon ( easy ) : FP and guardian of unaxio. 

Skervoxicon ( easy ) : well.. he's bad vs weapon based heroes specially when 4 FP to destroy his wotf 


I didn't face all this match ups yet in 2.9 but I've faced them manyyyy times in earliest versions and I am sure of the tactics as my deck was somehow similar 

Enjoy high rating and of course questions , suggestions and feedback is what I always love to see ! 

Feed backs please :/!!

http://www.shadowera.com/showthread.php?17086-Preybird-s-Deck-Thread
Call of the Crystals decks - Version 1.5

Gwen - The Bride: This allied Gwen has been tested, tuned, retested, tossed aside, brought back, rebuilt, and had some of the best minds in Shadow Era give me their input. Tournament ready.

Zaladar - Crystal Miner: My baby. I’ve had this deck almost as long as 1.5 has been out. My favourite QM deck. A modified version took me from 0 to 323 in the Season 5 reset before I switched it out.

Zaladar - Crystal Miner 2.0: A variant on my Crystal Miner deck, this is the card for card version that took me to 323 (as mentioned above)

Gravebone - Behemoth: An old deck, this was my opener for the 1.5 release reset (Season 4). Took me to 289. Very solid late game, the deck just gets stronger and stronger as the game goes on.

Majiya - Hybrid: This is a record breaker, netting me a 7 win streak in an internal King-of-the-Hill tournament. Very solid, very flexible. An excellent QM deck, and quite capable in tournament play.

Darkclaw – Wulven Forces: My surprise deck, and always fun to take out for a spin. An allied Darkclaw that gives people more to think about than the traditional SoloClaw.

Ter Adun - The Spartan: The result of my own raving insanity, this is probably as good as I think Ter can be, winning matches in the 300+ range. Warning: Not for the faint hearted!

Logan - Metabreaker: Of all the heroes, Logan fell the hardest in the balancing of 1.5. Time to bring him back

Eladwen - Hardened Rush: This is the deck that got me into the Top 100 in Season 5, climbing from 295 to 303 and #42 in the rankings. A very solid, no frills, ass kicking rush deck. (Hosted on the Shadow Era Network)

		3.1.1 A Guide to getting onto IRC 
Hi all,

I'm pretty certain some of the newer members to the forum are a bit unfamiliar with IRC, so I thought I'd post this. It's a quick and dirty guide to get on IRC. It's not an in-depth listing of all the slash commands and tricks, but simply a way to get online so you can start playing those custom matches!

IRC is most easily used if you are on a computer, and GDC has created a couple of mirrors to the Shadow Era web interface with IRC built in a separate frame:

Live Server:
http://shadowera.gondorian.com/gamechat/

Test Server:
http://shadowera.gondorian.com/testchat/

To use IRC, all you have to do is specify a username. It can be anything you want it to be, but usually most players will use the same IRC name as their forum name (unless they're trying to go incognito ). You'll find most guild members will tend to place their guild's acronym in front of their IRC name. E.G. AA1-Seragyn, A1-Busti, TJ-Cwhit, ASF-Preybird.

Enter your chosen username, then fill in the Captcha keywords and click ok. On GDC's mirrors you'll be taken straight to the IRC Shadow Era room.

On the right hand side you can see a complete list of everyone online. Down the bottom is the message bar. Type what you want and it'll appear in the main window. This is the public space, and anyone can see what you type. If you want to send a message to someone in particular, you click on their name then select query from the sub-menu. A new chat tab will open up and anything you type will only go to that person. (Great for setting up tourney matches, or just catching up with a friend). To go back to public chat, you can click the Shadow Era tab up the top.

On mobile platforms, there are a couple of extra steps. Firstly you need to download an IRC client. I'm not familiar with all of them, but they should be quite similar. Download one and run it. I use AndChat for Android.

Chances are you'll need to put in a default username in all of these through their menu systems. As I'm not familiar with all of them, you'll need to follow their instructions. This username will be automatically applied every time you log in.

Shadow Era's room is part of the Freenode network, so make sure if you're given an option to choose your network, you use Freenode.

Anyway, once you're logged on, the biggest difference is that mobile IRC programs do not take you directly to Shadow Era's room, you need to tell it that's where you want to go. This is the command:

/j #Shadowera

the /j means join. (Pretty straightforward )

This will put you in the right chat room where you can set up games and chat to the other players.

Anyway, hope this helps to clear up any issues/misconceptions about IRC.

--------------------------------
I've written up a bunch of information about IRC for A1, this looks like a good thread to share it in. 

Getting on IRC
Via Webchat 

This is the simplest method to join the chat, and works in most browsers. Go to webchat.freenode.net and enter the following details (bits that look like {this} need you to fill in):
NickName: {your Forum Name}
Channels: #shadowera

Auth to Services: Check if you have registered your Nickname (see below.)

UserName: {your registered nickname}

Password: {your password}

Recaptcha: Do the silly captcha

Click connect, and after ~15 seconds you will be connected to the #shadowera chat channel.

Note: Gondorian has created framed pages that have the webchat and the game on the same page, which is great for when you are doing tournament matches. Try them out - Live Server - Test Server

Via an IRC client

There are a huge number of IRC clients available for every platform, if you want a more full featured chat, it's the way to go. Some clients recommended by A1 members are mIRC, AdiIRC, kvIRC, TurboIRC (for windows) and Colloquy for iOS and MAC.

Most IRC clients come preloaded with a list of servers to connect to, find and select freenode or enter irc.freenode.net in the server field. Enter your nickname and fill in any other required fields before connecting.

Once connected, type /join #shadowera to join the shadowera chat.

Registering your nickname
Registering your nickname brings a number of benefits. It allows you to reserve your name, and ensures that no one impersonates you. As well, once you are registered you can access additional channel commands. Bits that look like {THIS} need changing to suit you. Don't include the {} and it doesn't have to be caps.

1. Go in IRC. Get the nick you want using /nick {NICK}
2. In the status box, type /msg nickserv register {PASSWORD} {EMAIL}
3. Confirm your email address by following the instructions it contains.
4. When you log in, you will need to identify. If you have a section in your client to automatically perform commands on startup, put this there, otherwise, just type it in. /msg nickserv identify {PASSWORD}
5. Once done, if you want to prevent others using your nick use /msg nickserv set enforce on
This will change your nick after 30 seconds if you don't identify using the command in 4.
6. If someone (or you) tries to use your nick and fails to identify, it will lock it. use /msg nickserv release {NICK} {PASSWORD} to unlock it.
7. If at any time you forget a command. Use /msg nickserv help

You can also go further and use /msg nickserv help {COMMAND}
e.g. to remember how to use identify, type /msg nickserv help identify

FAQ's:

Q: I see people changing their nickname to let people know their status. How do I do that?
A: Type /nick {New Nickname}. It's good practice to register any nicknames that you commonly use with nickserv. To do so, make sure you have already identified with your main nickname. Change to your new nickname using /nick {NewNick} and then type /msg nickserv group.
Q: I have nickname protection on, but did not identify within 30 seconds of logging in. Now my name has been changed and I am unable to change it back. How do I fix this?
A: You need to release your nickname, change to it, and then identify properly. To do so, type /msg ChanServ release {Nickname} {pass} then /nick {Nickname} and then finally /msg nickserv identify {nickname} {password}
Q: I see some users have an @ sign. What does it mean and how do I get it?
A: The @ sign denotes an operator of the channel. They are able to control / moderate the channel. 
Q: Why is some text in different colours?
A: There are a few different reasons why there are different colours in chat. If someone types your name in chat, it will highlight the line in different colour, and depending on the client play a notification sound. You can 'emote' by typing /me <action> which will appear in a different colour for other users.
